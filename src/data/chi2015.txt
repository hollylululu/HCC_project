%X Nature has engineered its own actuators, as well as the efficient material
composition, geometry and structure to utilize its actuators and achieve
functional transformation. Based on the natural phenomenon of cells'
hygromorphic transformation, we introduce the living Bacillus Subtilis natto
cell as a humidity sensitive nanoactuator. In this paper, we unfold the process
of exploring and comparing cell types that are proper for HCI use, the
development of the composite biofilm, the development of the responsive
structures, the control setup for actuating biofilms, and a simulation and
fabrication platform. Finally, we provide a variety of application designs,
with and without computer control to demonstrate the potential of our bio
actuators. Through this paper, we intend to enable the use of natto cells and
our platform technologies for HCI researchers, designers and bio-hackers. More
generally, we try to encourage the research and use of biological responsive
materials and interdisciplinary research in HCI.

%X The form factors of displays using fog or water surface are limited by our
ability to control the non-solid substances used as the diffuser. We propose a
charging technique for polar aerosols (e.g., mist or fog) that allows control
of the shape and trajectory of such non-solid diffusers using electric fields.
We report experiments that allowed us to design a charging mechanism that
produces charged fog aerosols with homogeneous electrical mobility. We
illustrate our idea by demonstrating how electric fields can be used to control
the shape of a fog display and the trajectory of a bubble display.

%X Recent work demonstrated the exciting opportunities that thermal imaging
offers for the development of interactive systems. It was shown that a thermal
camera can sense when a user touches a surface, performs gestures in the
camera's direct field of view and, in addition, performs gestures outside the
camera's direct field of view through thermal reflection. In this paper, we
investigate the material properties that should be considered for detecting
interaction using thermal imaging considering both in- and outdoor settings. We
conducted a study to analyze the recognition performance for different gestures
and different surfaces. Using the results, we derive guidelines on material
properties of surfaces for detecting on-surface as well as mid-air interaction
using a thermal camera. We discuss the constrains that should be taken into
account using thermal imaging as the sensing technology. Finally, we present a
material space based on our findings. The space depicts surfaces and the
required properties that enable the different interaction techniques.

computer screen into a z-actuating shape-changing display. This enables
designers to produce dynamic physical forms by "clipping" actuators onto
screens. ShapeClip displays are portable, scalable, fault-tolerant, and support
runtime re-arrangement. Users are not required to have knowledge of electronics
or programming, and can develop motion designs with presentation software,
image editors, or web-technologies. To evaluate ShapeClip we carried out a
full-day workshop with expert designers. Participants were asked to generate
shape-changing designs and then construct them using ShapeClip. ShapeClip
enabled participants to rapidly and successfully transform their ideas into
functional systems.

%X FluxPaper is a new paper-based medium that enables physical movement and
dynamic interaction between a high-power magnetized paper and a programmable
magnetic field. FluxPaper has a very thin patterned magnetic layer (0.1 mm)
pasted behind the paper. A thin but strong neodymium-based magnet realizes
fast, powerful, and precise physical actions while retaining the original
characteristics of the paper that is widely used in our daily lives. Owing to
an effective magnetic pattern and a computer-controlled magnetic field,
FluxPaper can add new interaction modality to ordinary paper. We describe the
functions of magnetized paper; challenges through realization; and the
interaction scenarios in several applications, such as self-alignment,
self-construction, floating on the board, and quickly picking out a target card
from a stack.

%X Tablet devices can display full-size QWERTY keyboards similar to the
physical ones. Yet, the lack of tactile feedback and the inability to rest the
fingers on the home keys result in a highly demanding and slow exploration task
for blind users. We present SpatialTouch, an input system that leverages
previous experience with physical QWERTY keyboards, by supporting two-handed
interaction through multitouch exploration and spatial, simultaneous audio
feedback. We conducted a user study, with 30 novice touchscreen participants
entering text under one of two conditions: (1) SpatialTouch or (2) mainstream
accessibility method Explore by Touch. We show that SpatialTouch enables blind
users to leverage previous experience as they do a better use of home keys and
perform more efficient exploration paths. Results suggest that although
SpatialTouch did not result in faster input rates overall, it was indeed able
to leverage previous QWERTY experience in contrast to Explore by Touch.

%X A natural way of communicating an audio concept is to imitate it with one's
voice. This creates an approximation of the imagined sound (e.g. a particular
owl's hoot), much like how a visual sketch approximates a visual concept (e.g a
drawing of the owl). If a machine could understand vocal imitations, users
could communicate with software in this natural way, enabling new interactions
(e.g. programming a music synthesizer by imitating the desired sound with one's
voice). In this work, we collect thousands of crowd-sourced vocal imitations of
a large set of diverse sounds, along with data on the crowd's ability to
correctly label these vocal imitations. The resulting data set will help the
research community understand which audio concepts can be effectively
communicated with this approach. We have released the data set so the community
can study the related issues and build systems that leverage vocal imitation as
an interaction modality.

%X This paper presents an investigation into musicians' ability to control
sound synthesiser parameters using various interfaces. The principal aim was to
compare separate, 1D parameter controls (touchscreen sliders) to
multidimensional controllers (an XY touchpad for 2D, the Leap Motion for 3D).
Subjects had to match a target sound as quickly and accurately as possible.
Results show that after about two hours of practice, the XY pad is 9% faster
than two sliders for no accuracy loss, and the Leap is 17% faster than 3
sliders with 9% accuracy loss. The multidimensional controllers improved most
with practice. A new perspective on Fitts' index of difficulty is presented:
"Index of Search Space Reduction" (ISSR). ISSR and retrospective accuracy
thresholds on the search trajectory are used to obtain straight line plots and
throughput values. These plots reveal that the Leap's speed improvement was
mainly due to reaction time, but the XY pad traversed the space faster.

%X We present a video annotation system called 'AnnoTone', which can embed
various contextual information describing a scene, such as geographical
location. Then the system allows the user to edit the video using this
contextual information, enabling one to, for example, overlay with map or
graphical annotations. AnnoTone converts annotation data into high-frequency
audio signals (which are inaudible to the human ear), and then transmits them
from a smartphone speaker placed near a video camera. This scheme makes it
possible to add annotations using standard video cameras with no requirements
for specific equipment other than a smartphone. We designed the audio
watermarking protocol using dual-tone multi-frequency signaling, and developed
a general-purpose annotation framework including an annotation generator and
extractor. We conducted a series of performance tests to understand the
reliability and the quality of the watermarking method. We then created several
examples of video-editing applications using annotations to demonstrate the
usefulness of AnnoTone, including an After Effects plug-in.

%X Much of the knowing employed in skilled craft practice is difficult to
communicate solely through written or verbal description. Consequently, the
reflection and development of a craft practice in this manner may miss
important nuances of practitioners' skills and experiences. We created digital
technologies to sonify (using audio to perceptualize data) a group of craft
practitioners' gestures to explore how we can aid their reflection in and on
their craft, and consequently develop it. Over a number of workshops, the
design of these sonifications were iterated based on how the practitioners
responded to them. We found that direct sonification of gesture (sounds
generated directly from motion sensor data) helped practitioners understand and
reflect upon their own and each other's practice, encouraged discussion and
enabled modification of craft technique.

with remote paper prototype testing as an approach and tool for enabling a
designer to wizard a paper prototype from afar while a user tests the prototype
out of the lab. This paper presents a system for remote paper prototype testing
that consists of (1) a video camera placed over a paper prototype, which
streams a live audio-visual feed via Google Hangouts to a tester, and (2)
Google Glass on the tester, which streams a live audio-visual-data feed to the
facilitator and wizard. Results from a pilot study found that remote paper
prototype testing helped designers gain valuable insights through use in

engagement, insight generation, and social interaction. We propose that a
controlled in-the-wild study offers a viable alternative when evaluating more
complex interaction methods in public space, hereby potentially reducing the
practical efforts of in-the-wild studies to involve participants.

investigation of the real-world practices of people who use paper-based
affinity diagrams and similar clustering processes in their work, in order to
identify challenges and requirements for technology support. Findings from
retrospective and artifact-based interviews with 13 participants suggest ways
in which the rich interactions and material affordances offered by paper are
key to the process. Instead of seeking to replicate interactions with paper on
a screen, simpler transfer of information between the physical and digital
worlds has the potential to address many of the most pressing problems
experienced in practice. We describe different types of technology integration
and augmentation, with preliminary recommendations for different situations.

%X Most Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers are accustomed to the
process of formal ethics review for their evaluation or field trial protocol.
Although this process varies by country, the underlying principles are
universal. While this process is often a formality, for field research or
lab-based studies with vulnerable users, formal ethics requirements can be
challenging to navigate -- a common occurrence in the social sciences; yet, in
many cases, foreign to HCI researchers. Nevertheless, with the increase in new
areas of research such as mobile technologies for marginalized populations or
assistive technologies, this is a current reality. In this paper we present our
experiences and challenges in conducting several studies that evaluate
interactive systems in difficult settings, from the perspective of the ethics
process. Based on these, we draft recommendations for mitigating the effect of
such challenges to the ethical conduct of research. We then issue a call for
interaction researchers, together with policy makers, to refine existing ethics
guidelines and protocols in order to more accurately capture the
particularities of such field-based evaluations, qualitative studies,
challenging lab-based evaluations, and ethnographic observations.

in which characters are designed to be reactive to the player's gaze in social
ways, such as getting annoyed when the player seems distracted or changing
their dialogue depending on the player's apparent focus of attention. Results
from a qualitative user study provide insights about how social gaze
interaction is intuitive for users, elicits deep feelings of immersion, and
highlight the players' self-consciousness of their own eye movements through
their strong reactions to the characters.

%X We present the results of a comprehensive video game study which explores
how the gaming experience is effected when several 3D user interface
technologies are used simultaneously. We custom designed an air-combat game
integrating several 3DUI technologies (stereoscopic 3D, head tracking, and
finger-count gestures) and studied the combined effect of these technologies on
the gaming experience. Our game design was based on existing design principles
for optimizing the usage of these technologies in isolation. Additionally, to
enhance depth perception and minimize visual discomfort, the game dynamically
optimizes stereoscopic 3D parameters (convergence and separation) based on the
user's look direction. We conducted a within subjects experiment where we
examined performance data and self-reported data on users perception of the
game. Our results indicate that participants performed significantly better
when all the 3DUI technologies (stereoscopic 3D, head-tracking and finger-count
gestures) were available simultaneously with head tracking as a dominant
factor. We explore the individual contribution of each of these technologies to
the overall gaming experience and discuss the reasons behind our findings.

%X Real-time games such as first-person shooters (FPS) are sensitive to even
small amounts of lag. The effects of net-work latency have been studied, but
less is known about local latency, the lag caused by input devices and
displays. While local latency is important to gamers, we do not know how it
affects aiming performance and whether we can reduce its negative effects. To
explore these issues, we tested local latency in a variety of real-world gaming
scenarios and carried out a controlled study focusing on targeting and tracking
activities in an FPS game with varying degrees of local latency. In addition,
we tested the ability of a lag compensation technique (based on aim assistance)
to mitigate the negative effects. Our study found local latencies in the
real-world range from 23 to 243 ms which cause significant and substantial
degradation in performance (even for latencies as low as 41 ms). The study also
showed that our compensation technique worked extremely well, reducing the
problems caused by lag in the case of targeting, and removing the problem
altogether in the case of tracking. Our work shows that local latency is a real
and substantial problem -- but games can mitigate the problem with appropriate
compensation methods.

diverse tastes of their customers. Although the gaming experience often depends
on one's preferences, the same may not apply to the level of their immersion.
It has been argued whether the player perspective can influence the level of
player's involvement with the game. The aim of this study was to research
whether interacting with a game in first person perspective is more immersive
than playing in the third person point of view (POV). The set up to test the
theory involved participants playing a role-playing game in either mode, naming
their preferred perspective, and subjectively evaluating their immersive
experience. The results showed that people were more immersed in the game play
when viewing the game world through the eyes of the character, regardless of
their preferred perspectives.

social media feeds, recommendations and personalized search results. These
algorithms have great power to shape users' experiences, yet users are often
unaware of their presence. Whether it is useful to give users insight into
these algorithms' existence or functionality and how such insight might affect
their experience are open questions. To address them, we conducted a user study
with 40 Facebook users to examine their perceptions of the Facebook News Feed
curation algorithm. Surprisingly, more than half of the participants (62.5%)
were not aware of the News Feed curation algorithm's existence at all. Initial
reactions for these previously unaware participants were surprise and anger. We
developed a system, FeedVis, to reveal the difference between the
algorithmically curated and an unadulterated News Feed to users, and used it to
study how users perceive this difference. Participants were most upset when
close friends and family were not shown in their feeds. We also found
participants often attributed missing stories to their friends' decisions to
exclude them rather than to Facebook News Feed algorithm. By the end of the
study, however, participants were mostly satisfied with the content on their
feeds. Following up with participants two to six months after the study, we
found that for most, satisfaction levels remained similar before and after
becoming aware of the algorithm's presence, however, algorithmic awareness led
to more active engagement with Facebook and bolstered overall feelings of
control on the site.

awareness of their friends. Facebook's News Feed is the primary mechanism by
which people are shown updates about their friends' daily activities on the
site in the form of an algorithmically curated list of stories. This paper
examines how people browse the News Feed, their perceptions and satisfaction
while using it, and the interactions they make with their personal social
network. We conducted a qualitative study involving think-aloud semi-structured
interviews as the participants casually browsed their own feeds. We observed a
wide variation in the use of the News Feed ranging from careful consideration
of social conventions, judgment of people, and annoyance and frustration
towards certain friends. Our findings suggest that people do not deliberately
curate their own News Feed either due to lack of awareness or perceived social
repercussions.

%X People are becoming increasingly reliant on online socio-technical systems
that employ algorithmic curation to organize, select and present information.
We wanted to understand how individuals make sense of the influence of
algorithms, and how awareness of algorithmic curation may impact their
interaction with these systems. We investigated user understanding of
algorithmic curation in Facebook's News Feed, by analyzing open-ended responses
to a survey question about whether respondents believe their News Feeds show
them every post their Facebook Friends create. Responses included a wide range
of beliefs and causal inferences, with different potential consequences for
user behavior in the system. Because user behavior is both input for algorithms
and constrained by them, these patterns of belief may have tangible
consequences for the system as a whole.

Japan, in English and Japanese. It finds these users are among the most active
and dedicated users in their primary languages, where they make many large,
high-quality edits. However, when these users edit in their non-primary
languages, they tend to make edits of a different type that are overall smaller
in size and more often restricted to the narrow set of articles that exist in
both languages. Design changes to motivate wider contributions from users in
their non-primary languages and to encourage multilingual users to transfer
more information across language divides are presented.

points of view lead to conflict. We focus on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
anyone may edit, where disputes about content in controversial articles often
reflect larger societal debates. While Wikipedia has a public edit history and
discussion section for every article, the substance of these sections is
difficult to phantom for Wikipedia users interested in the development of an
article and in locating which topics were most controversial. In this paper we
present Contropedia, a tool that augments Wikipedia articles and gives insight
into the development of controversial topics. Contropedia uses an efficient
language agnostic measure based on the edit history that focuses on wiki links
to easily identify which topics within a Wikipedia article have been most
controversial and when.

%X Localness is an oft-cited benefit of volunteered geographic information
(VGI). This study examines whether localness is a constant, universally shared
benefit of VGI, or one that varies depending on the context in which it is
produced. Focusing on articles about geographic entities (e.g. cities, points
of interest) in 79 language editions of Wikipedia, we examine the localness of
both the editors working on articles and the sources of the information they
cite. We find extensive geographic inequalities in localness, with the degree
of localness varying with the socioeconomic status of the local population and
the health of the local media. We also point out the key role of language,
showing that information in languages not native to a place tends to be
produced and sourced by non-locals. We discuss the implications of this work
for our understanding of the nature of VGI and highlight a generalizable
technical contribution: an algorithm that determines the home country of the
original publisher of online content.

the lens of emotional labor. Using a grounded theory approach, we detail the
kinds of tasks women Wikipedians choose to do and explore why they choose the
work they do. We also explore the emotional costs of their labor and their
strategies for coping. Our analysis of 20 interviews leads us to posit that the
gendered and emotional labor required of many women to participate in
Wikipedia's production renders it, problematically, a space of conflicting
public and private spheres, motivated by antithetical open and closed values.
In addition to other contributions, we believe this insight sheds light on some
of the complex dynamics behind Wikipedia's observed gender gap.

%X E-petitioning has become one of the most important and popular forms of
online activism. Although e-petition success is driven by user behavior, users
have received relatively little study by HCI and social computing researchers.
Drawing from theoretical and empirical work in analogous social computing
systems, we identify two potentially competing theories about the trajectories
of users in e-petition platforms: (1) "power" users in social computing systems
are born, not made; and (2) users mature into "power" users. In a quantitative
analysis of data from Change.org, one of the largest online e-petition
platforms, we test and find support for both theories. A follow-up qualitative
analysis shows that not only do users learn from their experience, systems also
"learn" from users to make better recommendations. In this sense, we find that
although power users are "born," they are also "made" through both processes of
personal growth and improved support from the system.

%X Head-mounted displays provide relatively hands-free interaction that could
improve mobile computing access for users with motor impairments. To
investigate this largely unexplored area, we present two user studies. The
first, smaller study evaluated the accessibility of Google Glass, a
head-mounted display, with 6 participants. Findings revealed potential benefits
of a head-mounted display yet demonstrated the need for alternative means of
controlling Glass-3 of the 6 participants could not use it at all. We then
conducted a second study with 12 participants to evaluate a potential
alternative input mechanism that could allow for accessible control of a
head-mounted display: switch-based wearable touchpads that can be affixed to
the body or wheelchair. The study assessed input performance with three sizes
of touchpad, investigated personalization patterns when participants were asked
to place the touchpads on their body or wheelchair, and elicited subjective
responses. All 12 participants were able to use the touchpads to control the
display, and patterns of touchpad placement point to the value of
personalization in providing support for each user's motor abilities.

%X Symbol-based dictionaries of text, images and sound can help individuals
with aphasia find the words they need, but are often seen as a last resort
because they tend to replace rather than augment the user's natural speech.
Through two design investigations, we explore head-worn displays as a means of
providing unobtrusive, always-available, and glanceable vocabulary support. The
first study used narrative storyboards as a design probe to explore the
potential benefits and challenges of a head-worn approach over traditional
augmented alternative communication (AAC) tools. The second study then
evaluated a proof-of-concept prototype in both a lab setting with the
researcher and in situ with unfamiliar conversation partners at a local market.
Findings suggest that a head-worn approach could better allow wearers to
maintain focus on the conversation, reduce reliance on the availability of
external tools (e.g., paper and pen) or people, and minimize visibility of the
support by others. These studies should motivate further investigation of
head-worn conversational support.

%X Persons with hearing loss use visual signals such as gestures and lip
movement to interpret speech. While hearing aids and cochlear implants can
improve sound recognition, they generally do not help the wearer localize sound
necessary to leverage these visual cues. In this paper, we design and evaluate
visualizations for spatially locating sound on a head-mounted display (HMD). To
investigate this design space, we developed eight high-level visual sound
feedback dimensions. For each dimension, we created 3-12 example visualizations
and evaluated these as a design probe with 24 deaf and hard of hearing
participants (Study 1). We then implemented a real-time proof-of-concept HMD
prototype and solicited feedback from 4 new participants (Study 2). Study 1
findings reaffirm past work on challenges faced by persons with hearing loss in
group conversations, provide support for the general idea of sound awareness
visualizations on HMDs, and reveal preferences for specific design options.
Although preliminary, Study 2 further contextualizes the design probe and
uncovers directions for future work.

lead to severe paralysis. Individuals with such disabilities can benefit from
interaction techniques that enable them to interact with the devices and
thereby the world around them. While a number of systems have proposed
tongue-based gesture detection systems, most of these systems require intrusive
instrumentation of the user's body (e.g., tongue piercing, dental retainers,
multiple electrodes on chin). In this paper, we propose a wireless,
non-intrusive and non-contact facial gesture detection system using X-band
Doppler. The system can accurately differentiate between 8 different facial
gestures through non-contact sensing, with an average accuracy of 94.3%.

iterative design with web analysts, we designed MatrixWave, a matrix-based

traffic patterns and interactively explore paths through the website. We use
color to encode differences and size to offer context over traffic volume. User
feedback on MatrixWave is positive. Our study participants made fewer errors

%X Analyzing multiple networks at once is a common yet difficult task in many
domains. Using adjacency matrices for this purpose, however, can be effective
because of its superior ability to accommodate dense networks in a small area.
We evaluate various representations and juxtaposition designs for visualizing
adjacency matrices through a series of controlled experiments. We investigate
the effect of using square matrices and triangular matrices on the speed and
accuracy of performing graphical-perception tasks. Based on human symmetric
perception, we propose two alternative juxtaposition designs to the
conventional side-by-side juxtaposition, and study how users perform visual
search and comparison tasks regarding different juxtaposition types. Our
results show that the matrix representations have similar performance, and the
matrix juxtaposition types perform differently. With the design guidelines
derived from our studies, we present a compact visualization termed TileMatrix
for juxtaposing a large number of matrices, and demonstrate its effectiveness
in analyzing multi-faceted, time-varying networks using real-world data.

%X With the rapid growth of rich network data available through various sources
such as social media and digital archives, there is a growing interest in more
powerful network visual analysis tools and methods. The rich information about
the network nodes and links can be represented as multivariate graphs, in which
the nodes are accompanied with attributes to represent the properties of
individual nodes. An important task often encountered in multivariate network
analysis is to uncover link structure with groups, e.g., to understand why a
person fits a specific job or certain role in a social group well. The task
usually involves complex considerations including specific requirement of node
attributes and link structure, and hence a fully automatic solution is
typically not satisfactory. In this work, we identify the design challenges for
mining groups with complex criteria and present an interactive system,
"g-Miner," that enables visual mining of groups on multivariate graph data. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through case study and in-depth
expert interviews. This work contributes to understanding the design of systems
for leveraging users' knowledge progressively with algorithmic capacity for
tackling massive heterogeneous information.

%X Animated transition has been a popular design choice for smoothly switching
between different visualization views or layouts, in which movement
trajectories are created as cues for tracking objects during location shifting.
Tracking moving objects, however, becomes difficult when their movement paths
overlap or the number of tracking targets increases. We propose a novel design
to facilitate tracking moving objects in animated transitions. Instead of
simply animating an object along a straight line, we create "bundled" movement
trajectories for a group of objects that have spatial proximity and share
similar moving directions. To study the effect of bundled trajectories, we
untangle variations due to different aspects of tracking complexity in a
comprehensive controlled user study. The results indicate that using bundled
trajectories is particularly effective when tracking more targets (six vs.
three targets) or when the object movement involves a high degree of occlusion
or deformation. Based on the study, we discuss the advantages and limitations
of the new technique, as well as provide design implications.

verbal/semantic memory to create a cognitive link between individual commands

experiment that showed that for learning 25 items Physical Loci outperformed a
mid-air Marking Menu baseline. A long-term retention experiment with 48 items
then showed that recall was nearly perfect one week later and, surprisingly,
independent of whether the command/locus mapping was one's own choice or
somebody else's. A final study suggested that recall performance is robust to
alterations of the learned mapping, whether systematic or random.

%X LeviPath is a modular system to levitate objects across 3D paths. It
consists of two opposed arrays of transducers that create a standing wave
capable of suspending objects in mid-air. To control the standing wave, the
system employs a novel algorithm based on combining basic patterns of movement.
Our approach allows the control of multiple beads simultaneously along
different 3D paths. Due to the patterns and the use of only two opposed arrays,
the system is modular and can scale its interaction space by joining several
LeviPaths. In this paper, we describe the hardware architecture, the basic
patterns of movement and how to combine them to produce 3D path visualisations.

%X The increasing availability of 3D interfaces brings promise of improved user
experience in diverse areas. Our study focuses on visual analytics, testing
whether 3D interactivity improves performance in a visual data exploration
task. Specifically, we compared scene rotation around vertical axis to a full
3D rotation using a InterSense IS-900 3D controller, in a task involving
trivariate trend detection in a 3D scatterplot. We found that, while 3D
rotation leads to slower performance, previous exposure to single-axis rotation
removes that difference. This shows that an interactive 3D scatterplot can be
an effective visual exploration technique for detecting trivariate patterns in
the data, and highlights the role of interface learning in design and
assessment of novel interfaces.

%X The hands of virtual characters are highly complex 3D models that can be
tedious and time-consuming to animate with current methods. This paper
introduces THING, a novel tablet-based approach that leverages multi-touch
interaction for a quick and precise control of a 3D hand's pose. The
flexion/extension and abduction/adduction of the virtual fingers can be
controlled for each finger individually or for several fingers in parallel
through sliding motions on the tablet's surface. We designed two variants of
THING: (1) MobileTHING, which maps the spatial location and orientation of the
tablet to that of the virtual hand, and (2) DesktopTHING, which combines
multi-touch controls of fingers with traditional mouse controls for the hand's
global position and orientation. We compared the usability of THING against
mouse-only controls and a data glove in two controlled experiments. Results
show that DesktopTHING was significantly preferred by users while providing
performance similar to data gloves. Together, these results could pave the way
to the introduction of novel hybrid user interfaces based on tablets and mice
in future animation pipelines.

and of 3D devices (roll and rotation) to unify 2D and 3D interaction. Our first
study explores RPM gesture amplitude and stability for different upper shapes
(Hemispherical, Convex) and hand postures. 8 roll directions can be performed
precisely and their amplitude is larger on Hemispherical RPM. As minor rolls
affect translation, we propose a roll correction algorithm to support stable 2D
pointing with RPM. We propose the use of compound gestures for 3D pointing and
docking, and evaluate them against a commercial 3D device, the SpaceMouse. Our
studies reveal that RPM performs 31% faster than the SpaceMouse for 3D pointing
and equivalently for 3D rotation. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept
integrated RPM prototype along with discussion on the various technical
challenges to overcome to build a final integrated version of RPM.

examination and debugging. Usage analysis from machine learning practitioners
building real models with ModelTracker over six months shows ModelTracker is
used often and throughout model building. A controlled experiment focusing on
ModelTracker's debugging capabilities shows participants prefer ModelTracker
over traditional tools without a loss in model performance.

%X Many HCI and ubiquitous computing systems are characterized by two important
properties: their output is uncertain-it has an associated accuracy that
researchers attempt to optimize-and this uncertainty is user-facing-it directly
affects the quality of the user experience. Novel classifiers are typically
evaluated using measures like the F1 score-but given an F-score of (e.g.) 0.85,
how do we know whether this performance is good enough? Is this level of
uncertainty actually tolerable to users of the intended application-and do
people weight precision and recall equally? We set out to develop a survey
instrument that can systematically answer such questions. We introduce a new
measure, acceptability of accuracy, and show how to predict it based on
measures of classifier accuracy. Out tool allows us to systematically select an
objective function to optimize during classifier evaluation, but can also offer
new insights into how to design feedback for user-facing classification systems
(e.g., by combining a seemingly-low-performing classifier with appropriate
feedback to make a highly usable system). It also reveals potential issues with
the ubiquitous F1-measure as applied to user-facing systems.

%X Psychological research has shown that 'peak-end' effects influence people's
retrospective evaluation of hedonic and affective experience. Rather than
objectively reviewing the total amount of pleasure or pain during an
experience, people's evaluation is shaped by the most intense moment (the peak)
and the final moment (end). We describe an experiment demonstrating that
peak-end effects can influence a user's preference for interaction sequences
that are objectively identical in their overall requirements. Participants were
asked to choose which of two interactive sequences of five pages they
preferred. Both sequences required setting a total of 25 sliders to target
values, and differed only in the distribution of the sliders across the five
pages -- with one sequence intended to induce positive peak-end effects, the
other negative. The study found that manipulating only the peak or the end of
the series did not significantly change preference, but that a combined
manipulation of both peak and end did lead to significant differences in
preference, even though all series had the same overall effort.

%X Waiting for the completion of a system process is an everyday experience.
While waiting, system provides feedback to the user about ongoing process
through temporal metaphors (Progress bar, Busy icons, etc.). One of the key
performance requirement for temporal metaphors is to retain the user till the
process completes. Researchers have evaluated these metaphors through
subjective means, and objective assessment has not been well explored. In this
paper, we present survival analysis as objective assessment method to evaluate
temporal metaphors. Through a field experiment, we demonstrate the application
of survival analysis and empirically establish that auditory progress bar
(temporal metaphor for audio interfaces) works for callers of a distress
helpline. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study on distress
callers. The paper further discusses the applicability of survival analysis for
evaluating temporal metaphors and wait time experiments for other applications,
tasks, and settings.

%X Deformable interfaces offer new possibilities for gestures, some of which
have been shown effective in controlled laboratory studies. Little work,
however, has attempted to match deformable interfaces to a demanding domain and
evaluate them out of the lab. We investigate how musicians use deformable
interfaces to perform electronic music. We invited musicians to three
workshops, where they explored 10 deformable objects and generated ideas on how
to use these objects to perform music. Based on the results from the workshops,
we implemented sensors in the five preferred objects and programmed them for
controlling sounds. Next, we ran a performance study where six musicians
performed music with these objects at their studios. Our results show that (1)
musicians systematically map deformations to certain musical parameters, (2)
musicians use deformable interfaces especially to filter and modulate sounds,
and (3) musicians think that deformable interfaces embody the parameters that
they control. We discuss what these results mean to research in deformable
interfaces.

paths, Trace enables people to send the paths to others. We designed Trace to
explore the possibility of emphasizing guided wandering over precise,

roughly one week reveal how walkers find Trace both delightful and
disorienting, highlighting moments of surprise, frustration, and identification
with GIS routing algorithms. We conclude by discussing how design interventions
offers possibilities for understanding the work of mapping and how it might be

%X Creating and utilizing simple links between items and locations in map-based
systems has become a mainstream component of modern computing. In this paper,
we explore support for "art mapping", an activity that requires consideration
of more complex interpretations of spatial relationships as users engage with
identifying locations of relevance to artworks. Through a user study of the
ArtMaps platform, and an exploratory study with professional artists, we
identify diverse interpretations of spatial meaning in relation to art. We find
that art mapping highlights potential for more active engagement with art
through technology, but challenges existing systems for spatial representation.
Through connecting our findings with work on designing for interpretation, and
on space and place in HCI, we contribute new understanding of creating
engagement through the spatial interpretation of art, and define potential
characteristics and uses of holistic "footprints" for artworks.

%X Interactive voice forums have emerged as a promising platform for people in
developing regions to record and share audio messages using low-end mobile
phones. However, one of the barriers to the scalability of voice forums is the
process of screening and categorizing content, often done by a dedicated team
of moderators. We present Sangeet Swara, a voice forum for songs and cultural
content that relies on the community of callers to curate high-quality posts
that are prioritized for playback to others. An 11-week deployment of Sangeet
Swara found broad and impassioned usage, especially among visually impaired
users. We also conducted a follow-up experiment, called Talent Hunt, that
sought to reduce reliance on toll-free telephone lines. Together, our
deployments span about 53,000 calls from 13,000 callers, who submitted 6,000
posts and 150,000 judgments of other content. Using a mixed-methods analysis of
call logs, audio content, comparison with outside judges, and 204 automated
phone surveys, we evaluate the user experience, the strengths and weaknesses of
community moderation, financial sustainability, and the implications for future
systems.

%X This paper explores discrepancies between the founding assumptions of mobile
and ubiquitous computing in the western world, and the starkly different
experiences of mobility and infrastructure to be found in many post-colonial
environments. Based on a field study of forced mobility and technology use
among populations displaced by the Hatirjheel waterfront development project in
Dhaka, Bangladesh, we make two basic arguments. First, we point to the partial
nature of assumptions around mobility that frame the imagination of mainstream
HCI research, and argue that different and heretofore residual experiences of
mobility must also be accounted for in post-colonial and other marginal
computing environments. Second, we document four forms of infrastructural
experience -- dispossession, reconstitution, collaboration, and repair -- that
characterize real-world engagements with infrastructure in such settings. We
conclude with implications for HCI research and design, and reflections on how
HCI researchers might better account for such experiences in their work.

%X Providing access to and training in ICTs is seen as key to bridging the
digital divide between technology-rich communities and those with poor IT
infrastructures. Several projects have focused on providing ICTs for education
in developing countries, of which the best known is One Laptop Per Child
(OLPC). Although, there has been significant criticism of some of these
projects, in particular OLPC, due to its use of a top-down implementation
strategy and the limited evidence for its educational benefits, there has been
comparatively little analysis of what underlies successful approaches. We aimed
to address this deficit by conducting an ethnographic study of community-based
projects organised by Blue Sparrow, a small charity that donates refurbished
desktop computers to schools in rural Peru, as this organisation has
experienced both successes and failures when implementing its educational
technology projects. The relative success of Blue Sparrow highlights the
benefits of: understanding local contexts; using a bottom up approach;
involving stakeholders in setting programme objectives; and empowering
communities. We argue that the educational impact of such projects can be
improved by: providing teacher training; integrating computers into the wider
curriculum; and providing teaching materials and clear objectives for
volunteers.

%X The regulatory climate is in a process of change. Design, having been
implicated for some time, is now explicitly linked to law. This paper
recognises the heightened role of designers in the regulation of ambient
interactive technologies. Taking account of incumbent legal requirements is
difficult. Legal rules are convoluted, uncertain, and not geared towards
operationalisable heuristics or development guidelines for system designers.
Privacy and data protection are a particular moral, social and legal concern
for technologies. This paper seeks to understand how to make emerging European
data protection regulation more accessible to our community. Our approach
develops and tests a series of data protection ideation cards with teams of
designers. We find that, whilst wishing to protect users, regulation is viewed
as a compliance issue. Subsequently we argue for the use of instruments, such
as our cards, as a means to engage designers in leading a human-centered
approach to regulation.

%X Smartphone apps today request permission to access a multitude of sensitive
resources, which users must accept completely during installation (e.g., on
Android) or selectively configure after installation (e.g., on iOS, but also
planned for Android). Everyday users, however, do not have the ability to make
informed decisions about which permissions are essential for their usage. For
enhanced privacy, we seek to leverage crowdsourcing to find minimal sets of
permissions that will preserve the usability of the app for diverse users. We
advocate an efficient 'lattice-based' crowd-management strategy to explore the
space of permissions sets. We conducted a user study (N = 26) in which
participants explored different permission sets for the popular Instagram app.
This study validates our efficient crowd management strategy and shows that
usability scores for diverse users can be predicted accurately, enabling
suitable recommendations.

%X Both governments and corporations routinely surveil computer-mediated
communication (CMC). Technologists often suggest widespread encryption as a
defense mechanism, but CMC encryption schemes have historically faced
significant usability and adoption problems. Here, we introduce a novel
technique called Open Book designed to address these two problems. Inspired by
how people deal with eavesdroppers offline, Open Book uses data mining and
natural language processing to transform CMC messages into ones that are vaguer
than the original. Specifically, we present: 1) a greedy Open Book algorithm
that cloaks messages by transforming them to resemble the average Internet
message; 2) an open-source, browser-based instantiation of it called Read Me,
designed for Gmail; and, 3) a set of experiments showing that intended
recipients can decode Open Book messages, but that unintended human- and
machine-recipients cannot. Finally, we reflect on some open questions raised by
this approach, such as recognizability and future side-channel attacks.

%X Interruptions while driving can be quite dangerous, whether these are
self-interruptions or external interruptions. They increase driver workload and
reduce performance on the primary driving task. Being able to identify when a
driver is interruptible is critical for building systems that can mediate these
interruptions. In this paper, we collect sensor and human-annotated data from
15 drivers, including vehicle motion, traffic states, physiological responses
and driver motion. We demonstrate that this data can be used to build a machine
learning classifier that can determine interruptibility every second with a 94%
accuracy. We present both population and individual models and discuss the
features that contribute to the high performance of this system. Such a
classifier can be used to build systems that mediate when drivers use
technology to self-interrupt and when drivers are interrupted by technology.

sensors for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Eleven patients with Parkinson's

during follow-up appointments for adjustments to the stimulation settings. We
examine the ways in which the patients and clinicians assess movement ability
together in the clinic and how these assessments relate to the treatment of
functional disability through DBS. We have found that effective assessment of
movement and treatment efficacy is a collaborative and interpretive process
(co-interpretation) that relies on input from patients, clinicians, and
caregivers. From these findings we describe the design directions for movement
sensors to support co-interpretation of movement in a clinical context as
opposed to simply movement definition.

%X Because the nature of chronic pain is complex, pharmacological analgesics
are often not enough to achieve an ideal treatment plan. Virtual Reality (VR)
technologies have emerged within medical research in recent years for treating
acute pain, and proved to be an effective strategy based on pain distraction.
This paper describes a VR system designed for chronic pain patients. The system
incorporates biofeedback sensors, an immersive virtual environment, and
stereoscopic sound titled the "Virtual Meditative Walk" (VMW). It was designed
to enable chronic pain patients to learn Mindfulness-based stress reduction
(MBSR), a form of meditation. By providing real-time visual and sonic feedback,
VMW enables patients to learn how to manage their pain. A proof-of-concept user
study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the VR system with
chronic pain patients in clinical settings. Results show that the VMW was more
effective in reducing perceived pain compared to the non-VR control condition.

designs are intended to be manufactured on a 3D printer and include assistive

%X Online dating sites have become a common means of finding a romantic
partner. And yet, these sites differ greatly from many other socially oriented
websites: perhaps most notably, the pairwise style of interaction afforded by
these sites prevents a robust online community from forming. Users, however,
have taken matters into their own hands by creating thriving external forums
for discussion of specific dating sites. We report on a multiple methods study
of two online dating services, via observation and interviews with users of the
forums associated with these sites. Our findings suggest that these forums play
an essential role in creating an "outsourced community" for the dating sites,
and also reveal practices around how some users "game the system" in online
dating, the prevalence of harassment in online dating, and users' frustrations

%X Social matching systems recommend people to people. In an ideal world, such
systems could be context-aware, in that they would introduce users to each
other in situations where they are mutually interested, available and open to
meeting (i.e., facilitate a valuable encounter). Unfortunately, today's systems
primarily match individuals based on simple similarity and proximity metrics.
This paper explores how contextual information available on today's mobile
phones could be used to identify opportunities for people to make valuable new
connections. Three types of context that are relevant for this work are:
relational, social and personal. We present insights gained from several
iterations of semi-structured interviewing (N=58) exploring these three types
of contexts and propose novel context-aware social matching concepts such as:
sociability of others as an indicator of opportune social context; activity
involvement as an indicator of opportune personal context; and contextual
rarity as an indicator of opportune relational context.

%X Striking up a good conversation with new acquaintances is often a difficult
problem. In this paper we report on the perceptions of wearable device users
who were given real-time personalized topic suggestions during a conversation
with a person they just met. Suggestions were generated using a ranking
recommendation algorithm, and were delivered via Google Glasses. We conducted a
study with 38 pairs of strangers, who received such suggestions while
conversing for the first time. Participants found the suggestions to be
helpful, but only at the right moments, and for certain types of speakers. Our
results contribute to the understanding of how communication interventions
influence people's experience and behaviors, and enhance interpersonal
interactions. Our study also presents design implications for applications on
wearable devices to facilitate conversations between strangers.

%X Nonverbal and unconscious behaviour is an important component of daily
human-human interaction. This is especially true in situations such as public
speaking, job interviews or information sensitive conversations, where
researchers have shown that an increased awareness of one's behaviour can
improve the outcome of the interaction. With wearable technology, such as
Google Glass, we now have the opportunity to augment social interactions and
provide realtime feedback on one's behaviour in an unobtrusive way. In this
paper we present Logue, a system that provides realtime feedback on the
presenters' openness, body energy and speech rate during public speaking. The
system analyses the user's nonverbal behaviour using social signal processing
techniques and gives visual feedback on a head-mounted display. We conducted
two user studies with a staged and a real presentation scenario which yielded
that Logue's feedback was perceived helpful and had a positive impact on the
speaker's performance.

%X Emerging over a decade ago, slow technology is a design philosophy aimed at
supporting experiences of reflection through and on technology in everyday
life. Recent research has suggested that slow technologies can open up new
forms of interaction with digital content that support self-reflection and
re-visitation of the past. However, little work has investigated people's
long-term interactions with systems that embody this design strategy. To
investigate, a qualitative study with 31 participants was conducted to
understand their long-term experiences with FutureMe-a slow technology that has
been in use for over twelve years by more than one million people. Findings
reveal that, despite its simplicity, FutureMe produced a range of outcomes-from
profound reminiscence to unsettling encounters. Findings are interpreted to
present opportunities and implications for future research and practice
initiatives.

%X Despite demonstrated interest in designing for reflection, relatively little
work provides a detailed explication of what exactly is meant by reflection or
how to design around it. This paper fills that gap by reviewing and engaging
with conceptual and theoretical models of reflection, organized by the
disciplinary and epistemological perspectives each embodies. Synthesizing
across this theoretical background, the paper identifies three dimensions of
reflection: breakdown, inquiry, and transformation. Together, these dimensions
serve as the foundation for reflective informatics, a conceptual approach that
helps bring clarity and guidance to the discussion of designing for reflection.
The paper distinguishes reflective informatics by demonstrating how it both
differs from and complements existing related work. Finally, the paper provides
a critically reflexive consideration of its own latent assumptions, especially
about the value of reflection, and how they might impact work on designing for
reflection.

%X Design methodologies for information visualizations are typically based on
the assumption that the users will be fully engaged in the visual exploration
of the displayed information. However, recent research suggests that there is
an increasing diversity in how users engage with modern visualizations, and
that the traditional design theories do not always satisfy the varied users
needs. In this paper, we present a new design concept, engagement-versatile
design, for visualizations that target users with a variety of engagement
styles. Without losing generality, we demonstrate the feasibility of this
concept through the designing of a system called Stock Lamp, an
engagement-versatile visualization that helps users keep track of the stock
market in real-time. This design process includes identifying different modes
of engagement, deriving design implications from each engagement-mode, and
applying them to the visualization's design. Our user study shows that Stock
Lamp is able to consistently relay market information even when the users are
multi-tasking. We believe this study establishes a new concept that promotes a
systematic design approach that leverages both theoretical and empirical design
methodologies for future visualization development.

%X Recognized stress management techniques include cultivating mindfulness,
breathing exercises, and meditation. While these approaches have been shown to
mitigate the negative effects of stress, they can be difficult to learn or
consistently apply. To support these techniques, we developed MoodLight, a
playful system that uses ambient colored light to provide feedback regarding an
individual's current arousal levels. Like many affective computing systems,
MoodLight was designed to help users observe their internal state and learn to
relax. However, our findings indicate that prompting or leading feedback can be
more effective than real time feedback in helping users relax. This work
contributes to affective computing by suggesting alternative approaches to
designing biofeedback systems for stress management.

to contribute to the improvement of practices of tutorial authorship in DIY. We
examine the quality of tutorials through the building and analysis of ten DIY
projects and tutorials. We analyze key issues across three categories: 1)
competences, components and tools, 2) sequencing, 3) and communication. We
offer findings that are both practical guidelines for detailed improvements of
tutorials and structural themes for improving tutorial authorship including the
themes of accurate information, competences and tools, and tutorial format. In
conclusion, we discuss the potential for interaction designers to
simultaneously mediate and shape tutorials and tools in a form of hybrid
design.

developed mostly within an industrial context. We question how non-digital
craft cultures can inform the design of digital tools. Furthermore, what
methods can help us understand these cultures in ways that are relevant to
digital practice? As makers ourselves, we see potential for collaborative
making to mitigate barriers in communication and provide insight into
non-digital practices and values. To evaluate this approach, we visited a
hunter-gatherer community that preserves an ancient craft, bringing with us
digital design and fabrication tools. Working together, we merged digital tools
with ostrich eggshell jewelry craft. We use this experience to draw conclusions
about making as a form of communication, the importance of supporting
appropriation and immediacy in collaborations, the challenge of combining
abstract design tools with concrete approaches, and the value of incorporating
design and making into communal life.

%X Communities of making have been at the center of attention in popular,
business, political, and academic research circles in recent years. In HCI,
they seem to carry the promise of new forms of computer use, education,
innovation, and even ways of life. In the West in particular, the maker
manifestos of these communities have shown strong elements of a neoliberal
ethos, one that prizes self-determination, tech-savvy, independence, freedom
from government, suspicion of authority, and so forth. Yet such communities, to
function as communities, also require values of collaboration, cooperation,
interpersonal support-in a word, care. In this ethnographic study, we studied
and participated as members of a hackerspace for 19 months, focusing in
particular not on their technical achievements, innovations, or for glimmers of
a more sustainable future, but rather to make visible and to analyze the
community maintenance labor that helps the hackerspace support the practices
that its members, society, and HCI research are so interested in. We found that
the maker ethic entails a complex negotiation of both a neoliberal libertarian
ethos and a care ethos.

%X Makers participate in remixing culture by drawing inspiration from,
combining, and adapting designs for physical objects. To examine how makers
remix each others' designs on a community scale, we analyzed metadata from over
175,000 digital designs from Thingiverse, the largest online design community
for digital fabrication. Remixed designs on Thingiverse are predominantly
generated designs from Customizer a built-in web app for adjusting parametric
designs. However, we find that these designs do not elicit subsequent user
activity and the authors who generate them tend not to contribute additional
content to Thingiverse. Outside of Customizer, influential sources of remixing
include complex assemblies and design primitives, as well as non-physical
resources posing as physical designs. Building on our findings, we discuss ways
in which online maker communities could become more than just design
repositories and better support collaborative remixing.

%X Modern smartphones correct typing errors and learn user-specific words (such
as proper names). Both techniques are useful, yet little has been published
about their technical specifics and concrete benefits. One reason is that
typing accuracy is difficult to measure empirically on a large scale. We
describe a closed-loop, smart touch keyboard (STK) evaluation system that we
have implemented to solve this problem. It includes a principled typing
simulator for generating human-like noisy touch input, a simple-yet-effective
decoder for reconstructing typed words from such spatial data, a large
web-scale background language model (LM), and a method for incorporating LM
personalization. Using the Enron email corpus as a personalization test set, we
show for the first time at this scale that a combined spatial-language model
reduces word error rate from a pre-model baseline of 38.4% down to 5.7%, and
that LM personalization can improve this further to 4.6%.

%X We present VelociTap: a state-of-the-art touchscreen keyboard decoder that
supports a sentence-based text entry approach. VelociTap enables users to
seamlessly choose from three word-delimiter actions: pushing a space key,
swiping to the right, or simply omitting the space key and letting the decoder
infer spaces automatically. We demonstrate that VelociTap has a significantly
lower error rate than Google's keyboard while retaining the same entry rate. We
show that intermediate visual feedback does not significantly affect entry or
error rates and we find that using the space key results in the most accurate
results. We also demonstrate that enabling flexible word-delimiter options does
not incur an error rate penalty. Finally, we investigate how small we can make
the keyboard when using VelociTap. We show that novice users can reach a mean
entry rate of 41 wpm on a 40 mm wide smartwatch-sized keyboard at a 3%
character error rate.

%X The advent of wearables (e.g., smartwatches, smartglasses, and digital
jewelry) anticipates the need for text entry methods on very small devices. We
conduct fundamental research on this topic using 3 qwerty-based soft keyboards
for 3 different screen sizes, motivated by the extensive training that users
have with qwerty keyboards. In addition to ZoomBoard (a soft keyboard for
diminutive screens), we propose a callout-based soft keyboard and ZShift, a
novel extension of the Shift pointing technique. We conducted a comprehensive
user study followed by extensive analyses on performance, usability, and
short-term learning. Our results show that different small screen sizes demand
different types of assistance. In general, manufacturers can benefit from these
findings by selecting an appropriate qwerty soft keyboard for their devices.
Ultimately, this work provides designers, researchers, and practitioners with
new understanding of qwerty soft keyboard design space and its scalability for
tiny touchscreens.

%X We study the performance and user experience of two popular mainstream
mobile text entry methods: the Smart Touch Keyboard (STK) and the Smart Gesture
Keyboard (SGK). Our first study is a lab-based ten-session text entry
experiment. In our second study we use a new text entry evaluation methodology
based on the experience sampling method (ESM). In the ESM study, participants
installed an Android app on their own mobile phones that periodically sampled
their text entry performance and user experience amid their everyday activities
for four weeks. The studies show that text can be entered at an average speed
of 28 to 39 WPM, depending on the method and the user's experience, with 1.0%
to 3.6% character error rates remaining. Error rates of touchscreen input,
particularly with SGK, are a major challenge; and reducing out-of-vocabulary
errors is particularly important. Both SGK and STK have strengths, weaknesses,
and different individual awareness and preferences. Two-thumb touch typing in a
focused setting is particularly effective on STK, whereas one-handed SGK typing
with the thumb is particularly effective in more mobile situations. When
exposed to both, users tend to migrate from STK to SGK. We also conclude that
studies in the lab and in the wild can both be informative to reveal different
aspects of keyboard experience, but used in conjunction is more reliable in
comprehensively assessing input technologies of current and future generations.

%X Online learning is increasingly prevalent as an option for self-learning and
as a resource for instructional design. Prerecorded video is currently the main
medium of online education content delivery and instruction; this affords
asynchronicity and flexibility, and enables the dissemination of lecture
content in a distributed and scalable manner. However, the same properties may
impede learners' engagement due to the lack of social interaction and peer
support. In this paper, we propose a time-anchored commenting interface to
allow online learners who watch the same video clips to exchange comments on
them. Comments left by previous learners at specific time points of a video are
displayed to new learners when they watch the same video and reach those time
points. We investigated how the display of time-anchored comments (dynamic or
static) and type of comments (content-related or social-oriented) influenced
users' perceived engagement, perceived social interactivity, and learning
outcomes. Our results show that dynamically displaying time-anchored comments
can indeed enhance learners' perceived social interactivity. Moreover, the
content of comments would further affect learners' intention of commenting.
Based on our findings, we make various recommendations for the improvement of
social interaction and learning experience in online education.

platform for the consumption of textual materials. However, although these
technologies are powerful, it is widely acknowledged that print documents
better support the advanced active reading tasks necessary to gain a deep
understanding of a text. While prior work to address this issue has aimed
improve digital eReaders by either leveraging familiar physical affordances or
by extending paper's capabilities with digital tools, in this paper we propose
a juncture of these two approaches. We first present a formative study that
captures the needs and requirements of users during active reading tasks with
tablets. We instantiate the findings in the design of a simple physical aid to
support active reading: a smart bookmark. We then define an interaction space
for this device, describe a set of interfaces designed to facilitate active
reading and close with a user study that assesses the potential of the bookmark
device and interaction techniques.

interviews with 10 cohabiting couples (20 participants) and an 8-day diary
study of communication and coordination. Using reported instances of
within-couple communication, triggered by relationship-oriented or practical
household needs, we identify why particular channels are chosen or sequenced.
Extending media richness critiques, we identify additional factors that
influence communication choice such as intimate knowledge of the others'
habits, possibilities to add emotional meaning, and couples' shared needs as an
identifiable unit. We also extend the notion of network effects on channel
choice, and discuss the ecology of channel, networks, devices and device
settings involved between partners. Finally, channel choice is not an
all-or-nothing game; multiple channels can, and must, co-exist.

%X Family communication and technology designed to support it is a widely

North America tends to assume high degrees of connectivity and Internet access.
We present a study of family communication practices in rural and northern
areas of Manitoba, Canada where Internet connectivity is intermittent or
severely limited in some communities. Our results show the ways in which
individuals stay connected with outside relatives can be hampered by
communication infrastructure challenges. In particular, these challenges can
dictate how, where and how often conversations with loved ones take place. Our
results also indicate that these experiences, many of which are negative, can
create lasting impressions that may be difficult to alter as infrastructure
improves. This suggests opportunities for designing family communication
technologies for outdoor locations with better connectivity, scheduling
communication during times with better connectivity, and combating social
isolation.

children can be problematic, but limited prior work in this space makes
defining appropriate use challenging. We conducted the first exploration of
whether adults feel pressure to limit phone use in this context and whether
they choose to do so. Through mixed methods, we collected data from 466 adult
caregivers at playgrounds. We found that phone use was a small part of
playground time, yet a notable source of guilt. Adults engaged in systematic
and specific phone-use and phone-non-use behaviors in order to prioritize their
children above themselves. Our results indicate that caregiver values and
self-control together predict behavior and can be used to model phone use in
this context. Users' mixed success with engaging in intentional periods of
non-use suggests that a design agenda which prioritizes cycles of engagement,
disengagement, and re-engagement may be of value to this group.

%X We study time-dependent patterns of information seeking about pregnancy,
birth, and the first several weeks of caring for newborns via analyses of
queries drawn from anonymized search engine logs. We show how we can detect and
align web search behavior for a population of searchers with the natural clock
of gestational physiology via proxies for ground truth based on searchers'
self-report queries (e.g., [I am 30 weeks pregnant and my baby is moving a
lot]). Then, we present a methodology for performing additional alignments,
that are valuable for learning about the concerns, curiosities, and needs that
arise over time with pregnancy and early parenting. Our findings have
implications for learning about the temporal dynamics of pregnancy-related
interests and concerns, and also for the design of systems that tailor their
responses to point estimates of each searcher's current stage in pregnancy.

that investigates the potential of these spectators in creating footage en

prototype app, RunSpotRun, as a technology probe to see what kinds of footage
spectators would produce. We present an analysis of this footage in terms of
its coverage, quality, and contents, and also discuss the implications for a)
spectators enjoying the race, and b) extracting the stories of individual
runners throughout the race. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges
that remain for deploying such technology at a larger scale.

%X Many studies have shown that crowd-support, such as cheering during sport
events, can have a positive impact on athletes' performance. However, up until
recently this support was only possible if the supporters and the athletes were
geographically co-located. Can cheering be done remotely and would this be
effective? In this paper we investigate the effect and possibilities of live
remote cheering on co-located athletes and online supporting crowds that have a
weak social tie and no social tie with the athlete. We recruit 140 online
spectators and 5 athletes for an ad-hoc 5km road race. Results indicate that
crowds socially closer to the athletes are significantly more engaged in the
support. The athletes were excited by live remote cheering from friendsourced
spectators and cheering from unknown crowdsourced participants indicating that
remote friends and outsourced spectators could be an important source of
support.

%X Difficulty in navigating daily life can lead to frustration and decrease
independence for people with autism. While they turn to online autism
communities for information and advice for coping with everyday challenges,
these communities may present only a limited perspective because of their
in-group nature. Obtaining support from out-group sources beyond the in-group
community may prove valuable in dealing with challenging situations such as
public anxiety and workplace conflicts. In this paper, we explore the value of
supplementary out-group support from crowdsourced responders added to in-group
support from a community of members. We find that out-group sources provide
relatively rapid, concise responses with direct and structured information,
socially appropriate coping strategies without compromising emotional value.
Using an autism community as a motivating example, we conclude by providing
design implications for combining in-group and out-group resources that may
enhance the question-and-answer experience.

an app permission manager and sending them nudges intended to raise their

qualitative and quantitative evidence that these approaches are complementary
and can each play a significant role in empowering users to more effectively

permission manager, participants benefited from nudges showing them how often
some of their sensitive data was being accessed by apps, with 95% of
participants reassessing their permissions, and 58% of them further restricting
some of their permissions. We discuss how participants interacted both with the
permission manager and the privacy nudges, analyze the effectiveness of both
solutions, and derive some recommendations.

%X Recent research has developed analytics that threaten online
self-presentation and privacy by automatically generating profiles of
individuals' most personal traits-their personality, values, motivations, and
so on. But we know little about people's reactions to personal traits profiles
of themselves, or what influences their decisions to share such profiles. We
present an early qualitative study of people's reactions to a working
hyper-personal analytics system. The system lets them see their personality and
values profile derived from their own social media text. Our results reveal a
paradox. Participants found their personal traits profiles creepily accurate
and did not like sharing them in many situations. However, they felt pressured
by the social risks of not sharing and showed signs of learned helplessness,
leading them to share despite their misgivings. Further, they felt unqualified
to significantly modify their profile contents due to a surprising trust in the
"expert" algorithm. We explore design implications for hyper-personal analytics
systems that consider the needs and preferences of the people being profiled,
suggesting ways to enhance the control they feel and the benefits they reap.

%X The aim of this research was to understand what affects people's privacy
preferences in smartphone apps. We ran a four-week study in the wild with 34
participants. Participants were asked to answer questions, which were used to
gather their personal context and to measure their privacy preferences by
varying app name and purpose of data collection. Our results show that
participants shared the most when no information about data access or purpose
was given, and shared the least when both of these details were specified. When
just one of either purpose or the requesting app was shown, participants shared
less when just the purpose was specified than when just the app name was given.
We found that the purpose for data access was the predominant factor affecting
users' choices. In our study the purpose condition vary from being not
specified, to vague to be very specific. Participants were more willing to
disclose data when no purpose was specified. When a vague purpose was shown,
participants became more privacy-aware and were less willing to disclose their
information. When specific purposes were shown participants were more willing
to disclose when the purpose for requesting the information appeared to be
beneficial to them, and shared the least when the purpose for data access was
solely beneficial to developers.

%X With the recent advances in using data analytics to automatically infer
one's personality traits from their social media data, users are facing a
growing tension between the use of the technology to aid self development in
workplace and the privacy concerns of such use. Given the richness of
personality data that can be derived today and the varied sensitivity of
revealing such data, it is a non-trivial task for users to configure their
privacy settings for sharing and protecting their derived personality data.
Here we present the design, development, and evaluation of an interactive
visualization tool, VeilMe, which helps users configure the privacy settings
for the use of their personality portraits derived from social media. Unlike
other privacy configuration tools, our tool offers two distinct advantages.
First, it presents a novel and intuitive visual interface that aids users in
understanding and exploring their own personality traits derived from their
social media data, and configuring their privacy preferences. Second, our tool
helps users to jump start their privacy settings by suggesting initial sharing
strategies based on a set of factors, including the users' personality and
target audience. We have evaluated the use of our tool with 124 participants in
an enterprise context. Our results show that VeilMe effectively supports
various user privacy configuration tasks, and also suggest several design
implications, including the approaches to personalized privacy configurations.

when connected to remote monitoring as ICD problems and issues are instantly
discovered compared to patients without a monitor. While remote monitoring is
intrusive in the domestic environment, little HCI research has investigated how
people live and interact with such monitoring technologies. We conducted a
study with 19 ICD patients and their spouses using diaries and interviews. Our
findings illustrate that our participants were satisfied with the monitoring
despite the fact that they had almost no knowledge of the data collected and
they lacked feedback from the monitor on transmission and operation. Based on
our findings, we describe a safety paradox for remote monitoring as
participants experienced less safety while being safer, and identify privacy
and surveillance concerns in the unequal monitoring of ICD patients.

%X The evolution of ubiquitous sensing technologies has led to intelligent
environments that can monitor and react to our daily activities, such as
adapting our heating and cooling systems, responding to our gestures, and
monitoring our elderly. In this paper, we ask whether it is possible for smart
environments to monitor our vital signs remotely, without instrumenting our
bodies. We introduce Vital-Radio, a wireless sensing technology that monitors
breathing and heart rate without body contact. Vital-Radio exploits the fact
that wireless signals are affected by motion in the environment, including
chest movements due to inhaling and exhaling and skin vibrations due to
heartbeats. We describe the operation of Vital-Radio and demonstrate through a
user study that it can track users' breathing and heart rates with a median
accuracy of 99%, even when users are 8 meters away from the device, or in a
different room. Furthermore, it can monitor the vital signs of multiple people
simultaneously. We envision that Vital-Radio can enable smart homes that
monitor people's vital signs without body instrumentation, and actively
contribute to their inhabitants' well-being.

%X Heart rate monitoring is widely used in clinical care, fitness training, and
stress management. However, tracking individuals' heart rates faces two major
challenges, namely equipment availability and user motivation. In this paper,
we present a novel technique, LivePulse Games (LPG), to measure users' heart
rates in real time by having them play games on unmodified mobile phones. With
LPG, the heart rate is calculated by detecting changes in transparency of
users' fingertips via the built-in camera of a mobile device. More importantly,
LPG integrate users' camera lens covering actions as an essential control
mechanism in game play, and detect heart rates implicitly from intermittent
lens covering actions. We explore the design space and trade-offs of LPG
through three rounds of iterative design. In a 12-subject user study, we found
that LPG are fun to play and can measure heart rates accurately. We also report
the insights for balancing measurement speed, accuracy, and entertainment value
in LPG.

important in optimizing human-computer system designs to improve performance
and efficiency. Traditional physiological measures, such as heart rate
variation (HRV), blood pressure and electrodermal activity (EDA), are widely
used but still have limitations in sensitivity, reliability and usability. In
this study, we propose a novel photoplethysmogram-based stress induced vascular
index (sVRI) to measure cognitive load and stress. We also provide the basic
methodology and detailed algorithm framework. We employed a classic experiment
with three levels of task difficulty and three stages of testing period to
verify the new measure. Compared with the blood pressure, heart rate and HRV
components recorded simultaneously, the sVRI reached the same level of
significance on the effect of task difficulty/period as the most significant
other measure. Our findings showed sVRI's potential as a sensitive, reliable
and usable parameter.

about factors that contribute to collaboration and learning around interactive

several multi-touch tabletop science exhibits. Observations of 629 visitors
were collected through two widely used techniques: video study and shadowing.
We make four contributions: 1) we present an algorithm for identifying groups
within a dynamic flow of visitors through an exhibit hall; 2) we present
measures of group-level engagement along with methods for statistically
analyzing these measures; 3) we assess the effect of observational techniques
on visitors' engagement, demonstrating that consented video studies do not
necessarily reflect visitor behavior in more naturalistic circumstances; and 4)
we present an analysis showing that groups of two, groups with both children
and adults, and groups that take turns spend longer at the exhibits and engage
more with scientific concepts.

combination of physical layout and task impacts cognitive maps of the virtual
space. Participants did not form a strong model of how different physical work
regions were situated relative to each other in the virtual world when the
tasks performed in each region differed. Egocentric perspectives of multiple
displays enforced by different furniture arrangements encouraged cognitive maps
of the virtual world that reflected these perspectives, when the displays were
used for the same task. These influences competed or coincided with
document-based, audiovisual and interface cues, influencing collaboration. We
consider the implications of our findings on WYSIWIS mappings between real and

%X Secondhand fashion is a rapidly growing, lucrative market with both off- and
online outlets. Studies of secondhand consumption have focused primarily on
people's motivations for secondhand shopping, highlighting sustainability
and/or thrift. We extend this work by looking at the motivations and practices
of secondhand shoppers who are driven instead by style, playfulness and
treasure-hunting. We present findings from ethnographic observation and
interviews with 13 secondhand shoppers. Three secondhand shopping orientations
emerged. Perfection Seeking involves seeking items that fit with an individual
look or personal brand. These items are seen as unique, and demonstrate an
alternative to mainstream fashion and consumption. Casual curiosity is less
focused, more engaged in browsing, and driven by both secondhand objects and
the secondhand experience itself. Digging involves the focused pursuit of
hidden "gems" or treasures, following the belief that unusual items are waiting
to be found. We offer ideas for designing secondhand shopping experiences to
support the needs for storytelling, experiential pleasure, and negotiation
around durable value.

certain settings. We study one such context-the elimination of cash payment on
London buses in July 2014. We conducted ethnographic fieldwork, interviews with
drivers and collected online and social media comments before, during and
shortly after the introduction of cashless fares. We explore how drivers and
passengers were fearful of the change due in part to a lack of information and
communication, the anticipation of negative effects on vulnerable passengers
and a compromise in freedom, flexibility and surveillance. We highlight the
ways cashless payments can alter the social function of money, create new forms
of work for drivers and passengers, and if not carefully introduced can cause
emotional stress and fears of state surveillance and control.

decisions. We found that designs informed by the endowment effect and loss
aversion theories and which communicated to savers the long-term implications
of their asset allocation choices, led users to adjust their behavior, make
larger and more frequent asset allocation changes, and achieve their saving
goals more effectively.

%X In this paper we present our results on using electromyographic (EMG) sensor
arrays for finger gesture recognition. Sensing muscle activity allows to
capture finger motion without placing sensors directly at the hand or fingers
and thus may be used to build unobtrusive body-worn interfaces. We use an
electrode array with 192 electrodes to record a high-density EMG of the upper
forearm muscles. We present in detail a baseline system for gesture recognition
on our dataset, using a naive Bayes classifier to discriminate the 27 gestures.
We recorded 25 sessions from 5 subjects. We report an average accuracy of 90%
for the within-session scenario, showing the feasibility of the EMG approach to
discriminate a large number of subtle gestures. We analyze the effect of the
number of used electrodes on the recognition performance and show the benefit
of using high numbers of electrodes. Cross-session recognition typically
suffers from electrode position changes from session to session. We present two
methods to estimate the electrode shift between sessions based on a small
amount of calibration data and compare it to a baseline system with no shift
compensation. The presented methods raise the accuracy from 59% baseline
accuracy to 75% accuracy after shift compensation. The dataset is publicly
available.

%X We propose a new way of eyes-free interaction for wearables. It is based on
the user's proprioceptive sense, i.e., rather than seeing, hearing, or feeling
an outside stimulus, users feel the pose of their own body. We have implemented
a wearable device called Pose-IO that offers input and output based on
proprioception. Users communicate with Pose-IO through the pose of their
wrists. Users enter information by performing an input gesture by flexing their
wrist, which the device senses using a 3-axis accelerometer. Users receive
output from Pose-IO by finding their wrist posed in an output gesture, which
Pose-IO actuates using electrical muscle stimulation. This mechanism allows
users to interact with Pose-IO without visual or auditory senses, but through
the proprioceptive sense alone. We developed three simple applications that
demonstrate symmetric proprioceptive interaction, where input and output occur
through the same limb, as well as asymmetric interaction, where input and
output occur through different limbs. In a first user study, participants using
a symmetric proprioceptive interface re-entered poses received from Pose-IO
with an average accuracy of 5.8&deg; despite the minimal bandwidth offered by
the device. In a second, exploratory study, we investigated participants'
emotional response to asymmetric proprioceptive interaction and the concept of
the user's body serving as interface. Participants reported to enjoy the
experience (4.6 out of 5).

%X Mobile audio augmented reality systems (MAARS) provide a new and engaging
modality to present information or to create playful experiences. Using special
filters, spatial audio rendering creates the impression that the sound of a
virtual source emanates from a certain position in the physical space. So far,
most of the implementations of such systems rely on head tracking to create a
realistic effect, which requires additional hardware. Recent results indicate
that the built-in sensors of a smartphone can be used as source for orientation
measurement, reducing deployment to a simple app download. AudioScope presents
an alternative interaction technique to create such an experience, using the
metaphor of pointing a directional microphone at the environment. In an
experiment with 20 users, we compared the time to locate a proximate audio
source and the perceived presence in the virtual environment. Results show that
there is no significant difference between head-orientation measurement and
AudioScope regarding accuracy and perceived presence. This means that MAARS,
such as audio guides for museums, do not require special hardware but can run
on the visitor's smartphones with standard headphones.

%X Document capturing with smartphone cameras is performed increasingly often
in our daily lives. However, our user study results (n=10) showed that more
than 80% of landscape tasks had incorrect orientations. To solve this problem,
we systematically analyzed user behavior of document capturing and proposed a
novel solution called ScanShot that detects document capturing moments to help
users correct the orientation errors. ScanShot tracks the gravity direction to
capture document capturing moments, analyzes logged gyroscope data to
automatically update orientation changes, and provides visual feedback of the
inferred orientation for manual correction. Our user study results (n=20)
confirmed that capturing moments can be recognized with accuracy of 97.5%, our
update mechanism can reduce the orientation errors by 59 percentage points.

%X Mobile video conferencing, where one or more participants are moving about
in the real world, enables entirely new interaction scenarios (e.g., asking for
help to construct or repair an object, or showing a physical location). While
we have a good understanding of the challenges of video conferencing in office
or home environments, we do not fully understand the mechanics of camera
work-how people use mobile devices to communicate with one another-during
mobile video calls. To provide an understanding of what people do in mobile
video collaboration, we conducted an observational study where pairs of
participants completed tasks using a mobile video conferencing system. Our
analysis suggests that people use the camera view deliberately to support their
interactions-for example, to convey a message or to ask questions-but the
limited field of view, and the lack of camera control can make it a frustrating
experience.

maps that presents risks to user safety and the environment. In order to
address this limitation, a large-scale means of mapping SURs must be developed.
In this paper, we introduce and motivate the problem of mapping space usage
rules and take the first steps towards identifying solutions. We show how
computer vision can be employed to identify SUR indicators in the environment
(e.g. "No Smoking" signs) with reasonable accuracy and describe techniques that
can assign each rule to the appropriate geographic feature.

%X We present a novel approach that integrates algorithmic recommender
techniques with interactive faceted filtering methods. We refer to this
approach as blended recommending. It allows users to interact with a set of
filter facets representing criteria that can serve as input for different
recommendation methods including both collaborative and content-based
filtering. Users can select filter criteria from these facets and weight them
to express their preferences and to exert control over the hybrid
recommendation process. In contrast to hard Boolean filtering, the method
aggregates the weighted criteria and calculates a ranked list of
recommendations that is visualized and immediately updated when users change
the filter settings. Based on this approach, we implemented an interactive
movie recommender, MyMovieMixer. In a user study, we compared the system with a
conventional faceted filtering system that served as a baseline to obtain
insights into user interaction behavior and to assess recommendation quality
for our system. The results indicate, among other findings, a higher level of
perceived user control, more detailed preference settings, and better
suitability when the search goal is vague.

intersection of these taxonomies. We study user search behavior on a
large-scale set of search sessions for each query type, examining
characteristics of sessions, query reformulation patterns, click patterns, and
page view patterns. We identify important behavioral differences across query
types, in particular showing that some query types are more exploratory, while
others correspond to focused search. We also supplement our study with a survey
to link the behavioral differences to users' intent. Our findings shed light on
the importance of considering query categories to better understand user
behavior on image search platforms.

%X We present a novel system for browsing through a very large set of images
according to similarity. The images are dynamically placed on a 2D canvas next
to their nearest neighbors in a high-dimensional feature space. The layout and
choice of images is generated on-the-fly during user interaction, reflecting
the user's navigation tendencies and interests. This intuitive solution for
image browsing provides a continuous experience of navigating through an
infinite 2D grid arranged by similarity. In contrast to common multidimensional
embedding methods, our solution does not entail an upfront creation of a full
global map. Image map generation is dynamic, fast and scalable, independent of
the number of images in the dataset, and seamlessly supports online updates to
the dataset. Thus, the technique is a viable solution for massive and
constantly varying datasets consisting of millions of images. Evaluation of our
approach shows that when using DynamicMaps, users viewed many more images per
minute compared to a standard relevance feedback interface, suggesting that it
supports more fluid and natural interaction that enables easier and faster
movement in the image space. Most users preferred DynamicMaps, indicating it is
more exploratory, better supports serendipitous browsing and more fun to use.

of best practices that maps bad scores to potential causes and corresponding
adjustments for optimization. During a case study in which we assessed and
optimized a real-world SERP, S.O.S. has proven its feasibility and
effectiveness by significantly improving the SERP's usability.

experience more interesting and memorable for children using haptic
augmentation. In this paper, we present FeelSleeve, an interface that allows
children to feel story events in their hands while they are reading on a mobile
device. FeelSleeve uses transducers and audio output from the tablet within a
gloved attachment to create vibratory effects that are meaningfully related to
story content. We describe a study investigating whether embedding such haptic
feedback into stories enhances reading for six to nine year olds. Our results
indicate that story events accompanied by haptic feedback are better
comprehended and appear to be more salient in memory. These results provide
evidence that haptic effects have the potential to improve children's reading
experience and make it more memorable.

show that FingAR Puppet promotes reasoning about emotional states,
communication and divergent thinking during social pretend play for children
4-6 years old. We suggest that this study opens an interesting space for future
AR systems to support complex cognitive and social development in early
childhood. We also identify broader implications from using theories of

%X The possibility of leveraging technology to support children's learning in
the real world is both appealing and technically challenging. We have been
exploring factors in tangible games that may contribute to both learning and
enjoyment with an eye toward technological feasibility and scalability.
Previous research found that young children learned early physics principles
better when interactively predicting and observing experimental comparisons on
a physical earthquake table than when seeing a video of the same. Immersing
children in the real world with computer vision-based feedback appears to evoke
embodied cognition that enhances learning. In the current experiment, we
replicated this intriguing result of the mere difference between observing the
real world versus a flat-screen. Further, we explored whether a simple and
scalable addition of physical control (such as shaking a tablet) would yield an
increase in learning and enjoyment. Our 2x2 experiment found no evidence that
adding simple forms of hands-on control enhances learning, while demonstrating
a large impact of physical observation. A general implication for educational
game design is that affording physical observation in the real world
accompanied by interactive feedback may be more important than affording simple
hands-on control on a tablet.

about. We explore this idea by creating Visual Answers, an exemplar social
microvolunteering application for Facebook that posts visual questions from
people who are blind. We present results of a survey of 350 participants on the
concept of social microvolunteering, and a deployment of the Visual Answers
application with 91 participants, which collected 618 high-quality answers to
questions asked over 12 days, illustrating the feasibility of the approach.

%X Classic ways of gathering data on human behaviour are time-consuming, costly
and are subject to limited participant pools. Crowdsourcing offers a reduction
in operating costs and access to a diverse and large participant pool; however
issues arise concerning low worker pay and questions about data quality.
Gamification provides a motivation to participate, but also requires the
development of specialized, research-question specific games that can be costly
to produce. Our solution combines gamification and crowdsourcing in a
smartphone-based system that emulates the popular Freemium model of play to
motivate voluntary participation through in-game rewards, using a robust
framework to study multiple unrelated research questions within the same
system. We deployed our game on the Android store and compared it to a gamified
laboratory version and a non-gamified laboratory version, and found that
players who used the in-game rewards were motivated to do experimental tasks.
There was no difference between the systems for performance on a motor task;
however, performance on the cognitive task was worse for the crowdsourced game.
We discuss options for improving performance on tasks requiring attention.

that everyone's time is valued equally. It has potential for community building
and reenergizing neighborhoods, but it faces several adoption challenges. We
report on the largest investigation of timebanking practices to date by
analyzing a combination of service exchange records from the three largest
hOurworld timebanks with over 3,500 members with 33,000 completed service
exchanges, and a survey of 446 members of over 120 hOurworld timebanks. Our
findings suggest that the ideal of 'equal time, equal value' that is at the
foundation of timebanking is a source of tension between members with
instrumental versus idealistic and altruistic motivations. We suggest that
future peer-to-peer systems must incorporate different rewards and incentives
in order to accommodate users with different motivations.

systems to obtain different perspectives and to determine if providers are
matching their system designs to the most important drivers of use. We found
that the motivational models implicit in providers' explanations of their
systems' designs do not match well with what really seems to motivate users.
Providers place great emphasis on idealistic motivations such as creating a
better community and increasing sustainability. Users, on the other hand are
looking for services that provide what they need whilst increasing value and
convenience. We discuss the divergent models of providers and users and offer
design implications for peer system providers.

separate waste, potentially because they do not know how to do it correctly or
are simply not motivated enough. We present the results of an online study
(N=184) investigating people's capabilities for classifying waste, their
capabilities to improve in this task over time and their current garbage
separation behavior. The study confirms that the Wisdom of Crowds is applicable
in this context as the crowd produces only half as many errors as the
individual and feedback helps participants to improve. Based on this, we
introduce the idea of a crowd classifying waste in a game, with their
classification result then being used as feedback on gamified public trash cans
to educate both the crowd playing the game and people using the trash can
playfully.

variety of online sources, including Twitter? feeds from the communities, from
governmental departments, and from the National Grid, and chats about it
continually using a number of synthesised voices interspersed with a variety of
jingles and sound effects. Designed to playfully reflect and comment on the
existing state of discourse and reports of practice in the UK, the Babble can
be considered both as a product and as a research tool, in which role it worked
to highlight issues, understandings, practices and difficulties in the
communities with whom we worked.

%X Addressing human impact on the environment by focusing on shared everyday
practices, rather than just individual behavior is an approach that shows
promise. However, it can be challenging to put this approach into concrete use,
especially in teams unfamiliar with the practice orientation. To support the
practice approach, we introduce the Contextual Wheel of Practice (COWOP), a
framework that can: 1) help researchers and designers to better understand
practices, 2) design effective interventions, and 3) facilitate collaboration
between team members from different disciplines, who may not be familiar with
the practice orientation. We describe how COWOP was developed, and our
experiences using COWOP in three different cases. We then position COWOP as
part of the "turn to practice" in HCI, and discuss how it can be useful to HCI
researchers and be applied in domains beyond sustainability, such as healthcare
and privacy.

%X Walking and other forms of physical activity have many health benefits, but
people often fail to follow through on their own goals of being more active. To
address gaps in current understanding of how to design technology-supported
physical activity interventions, we conducted a randomized field experiment of
a commitment device: making public announcements. In a control condition,
weekly commitments were kept private. In two treatment conditions, they were
announced on Facebook and by email. In one of the two, the announcements also
included results: whether the previous week's commitment was kept. We find
that, with or without public results, these posts can elicit supportive replies
from the poster's social networks. People in both public announcements
conditions were less likely to make commitments. We conclude that the prospect
of public accountability may suppress the making of commitments in a way that
counteracts the benefits of that accountability. Designers will need to address
this limitation in order to make effective use of public accountability as a
commitment device.

%X Researchers have created innovative technological solutions to support
people with common chronic illnesses. In this study, we investigate design
opportunities for people with rare diseases who are not well studied or have
smaller populations to work with, because although an individual's disease may
be rare, the number of people living with a rare disease is substantial. We
conducted an interview study with 19 individuals with rare diseases from around
the world to understand common problems and experiences that could be supported
through design. We found that communicating with friends, family, and providers
about her disease were challenges for participants. Additionally, participants
thought of their disease as being a large part of who they were. We discuss
these findings in the context of prior work on common chronic illnesses,
addressing the potential relevance of existing technological interventions for
people with rare diseases.

%X People prefer attractive interfaces. Designers strive to outmatch
competitors, and create apps and websites that stand out. However, significant
expenses on design are unaffordable to small companies; instead, they could
adopt automatic tools of interface aesthetics evaluation, a cheaper strategy to
good design. This paper describes an important step towards such a tool; it
presents eight automatic metrics of graphical user interface (GUI) aesthetics.
We tested the metrics in two exploratory studies -- on desktop webpages (N =
62) and on iPhone apps (N = 53) -- and found them to function on both GUI types
and for both immediate (150ms exposure) and deliberate (4s exposure) aesthetics
impressions. Our best-fit regression models explained up to 49% of variance in
webpage aesthetics and up to 32% (if app genre is considered) of variance in
iPhone app aesthetics. These results confirm past results and suggest the
metrics are valid and reliable enough to be widely discussed, and possibly, to
be embedded in our prospective GUI evaluation tool, tLight.

%X Despite technological improvements in commercial activity trackers, little
attention has been given to their emotional, social, or fashion-related
qualities, such as their visual aesthetics and their relationship to
self-expression and social connection. As an alternative integrated approach
incorporating HCI, fashion, and product design, our project made use of the
characteristics of patina to improve activity trackers as fashionable
wearables. We developed the Patina Engraving System, which engraves patina-like
patterns on an activity tracker according to a user's activity logs. Using a
piercing technique, the patina of activity logs has been made abstract,
visually rich, gradually emerging, and historically accumulated. During the
field trial, we found that the patina motivated the participants to increase
exercises for engraving aesthetic patinas. A tracker with patina triggered
spontaneous social interactions in face-to-face situations. The participants
also cherished the trackers that held their own history. Based on the field
trial, we discuss design implications for utilizing patina in designing future
fashionable technologies.

three-camera array, we developed a photo-taking interface that provides
real-time feedback on how to position the subject-of-interest according to a
photography composition rule: rule-of-thirds. We conduct a user study to
compare the aesthetic quality of photos taken with our real-time guidance
interface against a static gridline interface common to existing digital
cameras. Expert photographers and Mechanical Turk workers rate the aesthetic
quality of these pairs of photos. Results indicate the photos taken with our
real-time guidance interface have significantly higher aesthetics scores. This
study shows the potential in using camera array, computational photography, and
real-time guidance interface to help non-expert users take better photos.

%X Information graphics, or infographics, combine elements of data
visualization with design and have become an increasingly popular means for
disseminating data. While several studies have suggested that aesthetics in
visualization and infographics relate to desirable outcomes like engagement and
memorability, it remains unknown how quickly aesthetic impressions are formed,
and what it is that makes an infographic appealing. We address these questions
by analyzing 1,278 participants' ratings on appeal after seeing infographics
for 500ms. Our results establish that: 1) people form a reliable first
impression of the appeal of an infographic based on a mere exposure effect, 2)
this first impression is largely based on colorfulness and visual complexity,
and 3) age, gender, and education level influence the preferred level of
colorfulness and complexity. More generally, these findings suggest that
outcomes such as engagement and memorability might be determined much earlier
than previously thought.

%X Creating personal narratives helps people build meaning around their
experiences. However, novices lack the knowledge and experience to create
stories with strong narrative structure. Current storytelling tools often
structure novice work through templates, enforcing a linear creative process
that asks novices for materials they may not have. In this paper, we propose
scaffolding creative work using storytelling patterns extracted from stories
created by experts. Patterns are modular sets of related camera shots that
expert videographers commonly use to achieve a specific narrative function.
After identifying a set of patterns from high-quality storytelling videos, we
created Motif, a mobile video storytelling application that allows users to
construct video stories by combining these patterns. By making existing
solutions used by experts available to novices, we encourage capturing shots
with story structure and narrative goals in mind. In a controlled study where
we asked participants to create travel video stories, videos created with
patterns conveyed stronger narrative structure and were considered higher
quality by expert evaluators than videos created without patterns.

%X Creating graphic designs can be challenging for novice users. This paper
presents DesignScape, a system which aids the design process by making
interactive layout suggestions, i.e., changes in the position, scale, and
alignment of elements. The system uses two distinct but complementary types of
suggestions: refinement suggestions, which improve the current layout, and
brainstorming suggestions, which change the style. We investigate two
interfaces for interacting with suggestions. First, we develop a suggestive
interface, where suggestions are previewed and can be accepted. Second, we
develop an adaptive interface where elements move automatically to improve the
layout. We compare both interfaces with a baseline without suggestions, and
show that for novice designers, both interfaces produce significantly better
layouts, as evaluated by other novices.

a WBTD consisting of 3&times;3 tactors. We demonstrated that tactor types and
the temporal patterns and locus of a stimulus produce statistically significant
effects on the efficiency of a WBTD. The experimental results can act as a

limited screen area. In this paper, we introduce the SplitBoard, which is a
soft keyboard designed for a smartwatch. As the user flicks left or right on
the keyboard, it switches between the left and right halves of a QWERTY
keyboard. We report the results of two user experiments where the SplitBoard
was compared to an ordinary QWERTY keyboard, the ZoomBoard, SlideBoard, and
Qwerty-like keypad. We measured the initial performance with new users for each
method. The SplitBoard outperformed all other techniques in the experiments.
The SplitBoard is expected to be a viable option for smartwatch text entry
because of its light processing requirements, good performance, and immediate
learnability.

%X Interacting with smartwatches poses new challenges. Although capable of
displaying complex content, their extremely small screens poorly match many of
the touchscreen interaction techniques dominant on larger mobile devices.
Addressing this problem, this paper presents beating gestures, a novel form of
input based on pairs of simultaneous or rapidly sequential and overlapping
screen taps made by the index and middle finger of one hand. Distinguished
simply by their temporal sequence and relative left/right position these
gestures are designed explicitly for the very small screens (approx. 40mm
square) of smartwatches and to operate without interfering with regular single
touch input. This paper presents the design of beating gestures and a rigorous
empirical study that characterizes how users perform them -- in a mean of 355ms
and with an error rate of 5.5%. We also derive thresholds for reliably
distinguishing between simultaneous (under 30ms) and sequential (under 400ms)
pairs of screen touches or releases. We then present five interface designs and
evaluate them in a qualitative study in which users report valuing the speed
and ready availability of beating gestures.

%X People increasingly use smartwatches in tandem with other devices such as
smartphones, laptops or tablets. This allows for novel cross-device
applications that use the watch as both input device and output display.
However, despite the increasing availability of smartwatches, prototyping
cross-device watch-centric applications remains a challenging task. Developers
are limited in the applications they can explore as available toolkits provide
only limited access to different types of input sensors for cross-device
interactions. To address this problem, we introduce WatchConnect, a toolkit for
rapidly prototyping cross-device applications and interaction techniques with
smartwatches. The toolkit provides developers with (i) an extendable hardware
platform that emulates a smartwatch, (ii) a UI framework that integrates with
an existing UI builder, and (iii) a rich set of input and output events using a
range of built-in sensor mappings. We demonstrate the versatility and design
space of the toolkit with five interaction techniques and applications.

%X Current uses of smartwatches are focused solely around the wearer's content,
viewed by the wearer alone. When worn on a wrist, however, watches are often
visible to many other people, making it easy to quickly glance at their
displays. We explore the possibility of extending smartwatch interactions to
turn personal wearables into more public displays. We begin opening up this
area by investigating fundamental aspects of this interaction form, such as the
social acceptability and noticeability of looking at someone else's watch, as
well as the likelihood of a watch face being visible to others. We then sketch
out interaction dimensions as a design space, evaluating each aspect via a
web-based study and a deployment of three potential designs. We conclude with a
discussion of the findings, implications of the approach and ways in which
designers in this space can approach public wrist-worn wearables.

functional experiences of users with early TUI prototypes. By means of a study
to evaluate interactive dice prototypes, TUIkit's appropriateness for tracing
the effect of different physical attributes (e.g. shape, size, weight,
material, texture) on the functional and thus overall user experience was
investigated. The results show that separating physical and functional
experiences first and joining these afterwards, enhanced the evaluation of TUI
prototypes. By applying this approach, participants became more aware of how
they physically experienced the prototypes, rather than focusing solely on the
functional value of the prototypes. This awareness supports earlier studies
that suggest that TUIs consist of more than just interaction, and that form and
materiality has a strong impact on their user experience. Finally, we suggest
some future adjustments of the TUIkit method.

printed on paper, and thereby provide dynamic visual feedback on user
interactions without any display devices. The magnetic unit that is embedded in
each lens and mirror allows the unit to be identified and tracked using an
analog Hall-sensor grid that is placed behind the paper, so the system provides
additional auditory and visual feedback through different levels of embodiment,
further enhancing the interactivity with the printed content on the physical
paper.

%X This paper introduces FugaciousFilm, a soap film based touch display, as a
platform for Attentive Interaction that encourages the user to be highly
focused throughout the use of the interface. Previous work on ephemeral user
interfaces has primarily focused on the development of ambient and peripheral
displays. In contrast, FugaciousFilm is an ephemeral display that aims to
promote highly attentive interaction. We present the iterative process of
developing this interface, spanning technical explorations, prototyping and a
user study. We report lessons learnt when designing the interface; ranging from
the soap film mixture to the impact of frames and apertures. We then describe
developing the touch, push, pull and pop interactions. Our user study shows how
FugaciousFilm led to focused and attentive interactions during a tournament of
enhanced Tic-Tac-Toe. We then finish by discussing how the principles of
vulnerability and delicacy can motivate the design of attentive ephemeral
interfaces.

%X We explore 3D printing physical controls whose tactile response can be
manipulated programmatically through pneumatic actuation. In particular, by
manipulating the internal air pressure of various pneumatic elements, we can
create mechanisms that require different levels of actuation force and can also
change their shape. We introduce and discuss a series of example 3D printed
pneumatic controls, which demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. This
includes conventional controls, such as buttons, knobs and sliders, but also
extends to domains such as toys and deformable interfaces. We describe the
challenges that we faced and the methods that we used to overcome some of the
limitations of current 3D printing technology. We conclude with example
applications and thoughts on future avenues of research.

%X Despite significant progress in sustainable HCI towards theoretical
frameworks to guide design, there is a gap between theory and practice, so that
the impact of such frameworks is limited. As an initial exploration in bridging
the theory-practice gap, we conducted a study using one well-established design
framework, the Attachment Framework, to evaluate its applicability in use. We
conducted a comparative study with 14 designers to explore the effect of the
Attachment Framework on design, and evaluated their designs with 10 design
experts using a set of six design criteria. Our results indicated a positive
effect on the criterion of novelty, with mixed effects on attachment,
presentation, aesthetics, usefulness, and feasibility. We contribute a set of
challenges in the application of design frameworks to practice and offer a
critical reflection on how researchers can more effectively communicate
sustainable HCI design frameworks to practitioners.

%X Human-computer interaction should be natural. However, the notion of natural
is questioned due to a lack of theoretical background and methods to
objectively measure the naturalness of a HCI. A frequently cited aspect of
natural HCIs is their ability to benefit from knowledge and skills that users
develop in their interaction with the real (non-digital) world. Among these
skills, sensory-motor abilities are essential to operate many HCIs. This
suggests that the transfer of these abilities between physical and digital
interactions could be used as an experimental tool to assess the sensory-motor
similarity between interactions, and could be considered as an objective
measurement of the sensory-motor grounding of naturalness. In this framework,
we introduce a new experimental paradigm inspired by motor learning research to
assess sensory-motor similarity, as revealed by the transfer of learning. We
tested this paradigm in an empirical study to question the naturalness of three
HCIs: direct-touch, mouse pointing and absolute indirect-touch. The study
revealed how skill learning transfers from these three digital interactions
towards an equivalent physical interaction. We observed strong transfer of
skill between direct-touch and physical interaction, but no transfer from the
other two interactions. This work provides a first objective assessment of the
sensory-motor basis of direct-touch naturalness, and a new empirical path to
question HCI similarity and naturalness.

%X We address in this work the process of agreement rate analysis for
characterizing the level of consensus between participants' proposals elicited
during guessability studies. Two new measures, i.e., disagreement rate for
referents and coagreement rate between referents, are proposed to accompany the
widely-used agreement rate formula of Wobbrock et al. [37] when reporting
participants' consensus for symbolic input. A statistical significance test for
comparing the agreement rates of k&gt;=2 referents is presented in analogy with
Cochran's success/failure Q test [5], for which we express the test statistic
in terms of agreement and coagreement rates. We deliver a toolkit to assist
practitioners to compute agreement, disagreement, and coagreement rates, and
run statistical tests for agreement rates at p=.05, .01, and .001 levels of
significance. We validate our theoretical development of agreement rate
analysis in relation with several previously published elicitation studies. For
example, when we present the probability distribution function of the agreement
rate measure, we also use it (1) to explain the magnitude of agreement rates
previously reported in the literature, and (2) to propose qualitative
interpretations for agreement rates, in analogy with Cohen's guidelines for
effect sizes [6]. We also re-examine previously published elicitation data from
the perspective of the agreement rate test statistic, and highlight new
findings on the effect of referents over agreement rates, unattainable prior to
this work. We hope that our contributions will advance the current knowledge in
agreement rate analysis, providing researchers and practitioners with new
techniques and tools to help them understand user-elicited data at deeper
levels of detail and sophistication.

%X Managing and reducing error in number entry tasks is important, especially
in safety critical contexts. Understanding factors that can affect number entry
accuracy could help the design of more dependable systems. We present three
interventions for number entry tasks, inspired by known priming effects (where
exposure to prior stimuli can impact task performance). The interventions were
questions for the operator to answer before entering each number. Questions
related to the value/size of the number, its structure, and the context of the
number entry task respectively. Results of a within-subject study show that
although there was no significant difference amongst performance across
interventions, all three interventions helped to improve the accuracy of number
entry by reducing entry errors (by up to 40.8%) and unnoticed errors (by up to
60.7%). These are impressive gains and suggest the importance of more work in
this area.

%X In the past half-decade, Amazon Mechanical Turk has radically changed the
way many scholars do research. The availability of a massive, distributed,
anonymous crowd of individuals willing to perform general human-intelligence
micro-tasks for micro-payments is a valuable resource for researchers and
practitioners. This paper addresses the challenges of obtaining quality
annotations for subjective judgment oriented tasks of varying difficulty. We
design and conduct a large, controlled experiment (N=68,000) to measure the
efficacy of selected strategies for obtaining high quality data annotations
from non-experts. Our results point to the advantages of person-oriented
strategies over process-oriented strategies. Specifically, we find that
screening workers for requisite cognitive aptitudes and providing training in
qualitative coding techniques is quite effective, significantly outperforming
control and baseline conditions. Interestingly, such strategies can improve
coder annotation accuracy above and beyond common benchmark strategies such as
Bayesian Truth Serum (BTS).

method is based on enabling fast intuitive selections by the crowd from image
banks when responding to an idea. Visual summarization reduces the massed image
choices to a small number of representative images. These summaries are then
consumed at a glance by designers receiving the feedback leading to thoughtful
reflection on their designs. We report an evaluation using two types of imagery
for feedback. Twelve designers took part, receiving visual feedback in response
to their designs. In semi-structured interviews they described their
interpretation of the feedback, how it inspired them to change their designs
and contrasted it with text feedback. Eleven of the twelve designers revealed
that they would be enthusiastic users of a service providing this new mode of
feedback.

%X Crowdsourcing systems lack effective measures of the effort required to
complete each task. Without knowing how much time workers need to execute a
task well, requesters struggle to accurately structure and price their work.
Objective measures of effort could better help workers identify tasks that are
worth their time. We propose a data-driven effort metric, ETA (error-time
area), that can be used to determine a task's fair price. It empirically models
the relationship between time and error rate by manipulating the time that
workers have to complete a task. ETA reports the area under the error-time
curve as a continuous metric of worker effort. The curve's 10th percentile is
also interpretable as the minimum time most workers require to complete the
task without error, which can be used to price the task. We validate the ETA
metric on ten common crowdsourcing tasks, including tagging, transcription, and
search, and find that ETA closely tracks how workers would rank these tasks by
effort. We also demonstrate how ETA allows requesters to rapidly iterate on
task designs and measure whether the changes improve worker efficiency. Our
findings can facilitate the process of designing, pricing, and allocating
crowdsourcing tasks.

%X A common approach in crowdsourcing is to break large tasks into small
microtasks so that they can be parallelized across many crowd workers and so
that redundant work can be more easily compared for quality control. In
practice, this can result in the microtasks being presented out of their
natural order and often introduces delays between individual microtasks. In
this paper, we demonstrate in a study of 338 crowd workers that non-sequential
microtasks and the introduction of delays significantly decreases worker
performance. We show that interruptions where a large delay occurs between two
related tasks can cause up to a 102% slowdown in completion time, and
interruptions where workers are asked to perform different tasks in sequence
can slow down completion time by 57%. We conclude with a set of design
guidelines to improve both worker performance and realized pay, and
instructions for implementing these changes in existing interfaces for crowd
work.

diversity are two key characteristics of crowds; however their relationship to
performance is often paradoxical. To better understand the effects of crowd
size and diversity on crowd performance we conducted a study on the quality of
4,317 articles in the WikiProject Film community. The results of our study
suggest that crowd size leads to better performance when crowds are more
diverse. However, there is a break-even point -- smaller, less diverse crowds
can outperform more diverse crowds of similar size. Our results offer new
insights into the effects of size and diversity on the performance of crowds.

questions for fallback authentication. In case users lose access to their
device, the system asks questions about their usage behavior (e.g. calls, text
messages or app usage). We performed two consecutive user studies with real
users and real adversaries to identify questions that work well in the sense
that they are easy to answer for the genuine user, but hard to guess for an
adversary. The results show that app installations and communication are the
most promising categories of questions. Using three questions from the
evaluated categories was sufficient to get an accuracy of 95.5% -- 100%.

%X Authentication methods can be improved by considering implicit, individual
behavioural cues. In particular, verifying users based on typing behaviour has
been widely studied with physical keyboards. On mobile touchscreens, the same
concepts have been applied with little adaptations so far. This paper presents
the first reported study on mobile keystroke biometrics which compares
touch-specific features between three different hand postures and evaluation
schemes. Based on 20.160 password entries from a study with 28 participants
over two weeks, we show that including spatial touch features reduces implicit
authentication equal error rates (EER) by 26.4 -- 36.8% relative to the
previously used temporal features. We also show that authentication works
better for some hand postures than others. To improve applicability and
usability, we further quantify the influence of common evaluation assumptions:
known attacker data, training and testing on data from a single typing session,
and fixed hand postures. We show that these practices can lead to overly
optimistic evaluations. In consequence, we describe evaluation recommendations,
a probabilistic framework to handle unknown hand postures, and ideas for
further improvements.

compare them to current state-of-the-art systems. Our findings show that Glass

%X Feedback about privacy-affecting system operations is important for informed
end-user privacy management. While feedback is most relevant if provided
immediately, such delivery interrupts the user and risks disrupting ongoing
tasks. The timing, volume, and nature of feedback is therefore critical for
avoiding inopportune interruption. We varied the timing and actionability of
feedback regarding accesses to a user's physical location. We found that the
sense of privacy violation was heightened when feedback was immediate, but not
actionable. While immediate and actionable feedback may sometimes be necessary,
our findings suggest that moderately delayed feedback is often acceptable. A
moderate delay may serve as a compromise to minimize interruption and avoid
overly alarming reaction to immediate feedback. However, immediate and
actionable feedback could still be beneficial when privacy sensitivity is high
or ambiguous.

team of caregivers that includes multiple types of medical professionals,
parents and community support organizations. Coordination of their outpatient
care, essential for good outcomes, presents major challenges. Extensive
healthcare research has shown that the use of integrated, team-based care plans
improves care coordination, but such plans are rarely deployed in practice.
This paper reports on a study of care teams treating children with complex

barriers to plan implementation and resultant care coordination problems. It
revealed the complex nature of teamwork in complex care, which poses challenges
to team coordination that extend beyond those identified in prior work and
handled by existing coordination systems. The paper builds on a computational
teamwork theory to identify opportunities for technology to support increased
plan-based complex-care coordination and to propose design approaches for
systems that enable and enhance such coordination.

%X A growing body of HCI4D research studies the use of SMS communication to
deliver health and information services to underserved populations. This paper
contributes a novel dimension to this field of study by examining if a hybrid
computer-human SMS system can engage pregnant women in Kenya in health-related
communication. Our approach leverages the different strengths of both the
computer and the human. The computer automates the bulk-sending of personalized
messages to patients, allowing the human to read patients' replies and respond
to those in need of attention. Findings from a 12-month deployment with 100
women show that our approach is capable of engaging the majority of
participants in health-related conversations. We show that receiving messages
from the system triggers participant communication and the amount of
communication increases as participants approach their expected due date. In
addition, analysis of participants' messages shows that they often contain
sensitive health information conveyed through a complex mixture of languages
and 'txting' abbreviations, all of which highlight the benefits of including a
human in the workflow. Our findings are relevant for HCI researchers and
practitioners interested in understanding or engaging underserved populations.

%X Selective exposure, the preferential seeking of confirmatory information,
can potentially exacerbate fragmentation of online opinions and lead to biased
decisions. We tested whether features that allowed users to better distinguish
information about different issue aspects would encourage them to take
different perspectives, thereby moderating the negative influence of
pre-existing beliefs on information seeking. Using an information aggregator
that provided drug related comments, we conducted an experiment to study the
impact of aspect indicators (indicating whether the comment was about
effectiveness or side effects) on moderating selective exposure. We found that,
when participants were asked to decide between medications for high-risk
diseases, and had preexisting biased beliefs in their effectiveness (one
medication was less effective than the other), without aspect indicators they
exhibited selective exposure to both types of comments (effectiveness and side
effects) and were biased to choose the medication in confirmation of their
pre-existing beliefs. With aspect indicators, we found reduced selective
exposure to information about side effects of the medications, and as a result
their overall decision bias was mitigated. However, the effect of aspect
indicators in reducing selective exposure was moderated by the decision
contexts, including the perceived risk of the diseases and whether the aspect
was perceived to be critical to the decision.

%X We present the results of three web-based field experiments, in which we
evaluate the impact of using initial narrative visualization techniques and
storytelling on user-engagement with exploratory information visualizations. We
conducted these experiments on a popular news and opinion outlet, and on a
popular visualization gallery website. While data-journalism exposes
visualizations to a large public, we do not know how effectively this public
makes sense of interactive graphics, and in particular if people explore them
to gain additional insight to that provided by the journalists. In contrast to
our hypotheses, our results indicate that augmenting exploratory visualizations
with introductory 'stories' does not seem to increase user-engagement in
exploration.

%X Data videos, motion graphics that incorporate visualizations about facts,
are increasingly gaining popularity as a means of telling stories with data.
However, very little is systematically recorded about (a) what elements are
featured in data videos and (b) the processes used to create them. In this
article, we provide initial insights to build this knowledge. We first report
on a qualitative analysis of 50 professionally designed data videos, extracting
and exposing their most salient constituents. Second, we report on a series of
workshops with experienced storytellers from cinematography, graphics design
and screenplay writing. We provided them with a set of data facts and
visualizations and observed them create storyboards for data videos. From these
exploratory studies, we derive broader implications for the design of an
authoring tool to enable a wide audience to create data videos. Our findings
highlight the importance of providing a flexible tool supporting a non-linear
creation process and allowing users to iteratively go back to different phases
of the process.

%X In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of deceptive visualizations.
We start with an in-depth analysis of what deception means in the context of
data visualization, and categorize deceptive visualizations based on the type
of deception they lead to. We identify popular distortion techniques and the
type of visualizations those distortions can be applied to, and formalize why
deception occurs with those distortions. We create four deceptive
visualizations using the selected distortion techniques, and run a crowdsourced
user study to identify the deceptiveness of those visualizations. We then
present the findings of our study and show how deceptive each of these visual
distortion techniques are, and for what kind of questions the misinterpretation
occurs. We also analyze individual differences among participants and present
the effect of some of those variables on participants' responses. This paper
presents a first step in empirically studying deceptive visualizations, and
will pave the way for more research in this direction.

%X Software is typically developed incrementally and released in stages.
Planning these releases involves deciding which features of the system should
be implemented for each release. This is a complex planning process involving
numerous trade-offs-constraints and factors that often make decisions
difficult. Since the success of a product depends on this plan, it is important
to understand the trade-offs between different release plans in order to make
an informed choice. We present STRATOS, a tool that simultaneously visualizes
several software release plans. The visualization shows several attributes
about each plan that are important to planners. Multiple plans are shown in a
single layout to help planners find and understand the trade-offs between
alternative plans. We evaluated our tool via a qualitative study and found that
STRATOS enables a range of decision-making processes, helping participants
decide on which plan is most optimal.

%X Mobile devices offer constant connectivity to the world, which can
negatively affect in-person interaction. Current approaches to minimizing the
social disruption and improving the subtlety of interactions tend to focus on
the development of inconspicuous devices that provide basic input or output.
This paper presents a more general approach to subtle interaction and
demonstrates how a number of principles from magic can be leveraged to improve
subtlety. It also presents a framework that can be used to classify subtle
interfaces along with a modular set of novel interfaces that fit within this
framework. Lastly, the paper presents a new evaluation paradigm specifically
designed to assess the subtlety of interactions. This paradigm is used to
compare traditional approaches to our new subtle approaches. We find our new
approaches are over five times more subtle than traditional interactions, even
when participants are aware of the technologies being used.

%X As large-screen smartphones are trending, they bring a new set of challenges
such as acquiring unreachable screen targets using one hand. To understand
users' touch behavior on large mobile touchscreens, we conducted an empirical
experiment to discover their usage patterns of tilting devices toward their
thumbs to touch screen regions. Exploiting this natural tilting behavior, we
designed three novel mobile interaction techniques: TiltSlide, TiltReduction,
and TiltCursor. We conducted a controlled experiment to compare our methods
with other existing methods, and then evaluated them in real mobile phone
scenarios such as sending an e-mail and web surfing. We constructed a design
space for one-hand targeting interactions and proposed design considerations
for one-hand targeting in real mobile phone circumstances.

%X Smartphones are becoming larger, mainly because bigger screens offer a
better experience for viewing content. One drawback of larger screens is that
they make single-hand interactions difficult because of hard to reach touch
targets and of the need to re-grip the device, both factors significantly
reducing their usability. Flexible smartphones offer an opportunity for
addressing this issue. We first set out to determine the use of common
single-hand mobile interactions through an online survey. Then, we designed and
evaluated one-handed deformable gestures that offer the potential for
addressing the finger reach limitation on large smartphones. We identified that
the top right up bend and the center squeeze up gestures are the fastest and
preferred gestures. We found no hand preference, which indicates that the
gestures could be implemented to fit the needs of a wider range of the
population, instead of favoring right-handed users. Finally, we discuss the
impact on deformable gestures on one-handed interactions issues.

%X In order to reach targets with one hand on common large mobile touch
displays, users tilt and shift the device in their hand. In this work, we use
this grip change as a continuous information stream for detecting where the
user will touch while their finger is still en-route. We refer to this as in
the air prediction. We show that grip change detected using standard mobile
motion sensors produces similar in the air touch point predictions to
techniques that use auxiliary sensor arrays, even in varying physical scenarios
such as interacting in a moving vehicle. Finally, our model that combines grip
change and the resulting touch point predicted where users intended to land,
lowering error rates by 41%.

%X Dynamic peephole navigation represents a technique for navigating large
information spaces in an egocentric way. Studies have shown cognitive benefits
for a vertical peephole orientation, when compared to non-egocentric
interaction styles. To see how the aspect of canvas orientation effects user
performance, we conducted a study (N=16) which revealed that canvas orientation
has no significant effect on either navigation performance or spatial memory.
We also found a significantly lower physical demand and a higher mental demand
in the horizontal orientation. For short-term activities we therefore propose a
vertical orientation, while for long-term activities horizontal dynamic
peephole navigation is more suitable.

%X Teachers in conventional classrooms often ask learners to express themselves
and show their thought processes by speaking out loud, drawing on a whiteboard,
or even using physical objects. Despite the pedagogical value of such
activities, interactive exercises available in most online learning platforms
are constrained to multiple-choice and short answer questions. We introduce
RIMES, a system for easily authoring, recording, and reviewing interactive
multimedia exercises embedded in lecture videos. With RIMES, teachers can
prompt learners to record their responses to an activity using video, audio,
and inking while watching lecture videos. Teachers can then review and interact
with all the learners' responses in an aggregated gallery. We evaluated RIMES
with 19 teachers and 25 students. Teachers created a diverse set of activities
across multiple subjects that tested deep conceptual and procedural knowledge.
Teachers found the exercises useful for capturing students' thought processes,
identifying misconceptions, and engaging students with content.

%X Interactive learning environments such as intelligent tutoring systems and
software tutorials often teach procedures with step-by-step demonstrations.
This instructional scaffolding is typically authored by hand, and little can be
reused across problem domains. In this work, we present a framework for
generating interactive tutorials from an algorithmic representation of the
problem-solving thought process. Given a set of mappings between programming
language constructs and user interface elements, we step through this algorithm
line-by-line to trigger visual explanations of each step. This approach allows
us to automatically generate tutorials for any example problem that can be
solved with this algorithm. We describe two prototype implementations in the
domains of K-12 mathematics and educational games, and present results from two
user studies showing that educational technologists can author thought-process
procedures and that generated tutorials can effectively teach a new procedure
to students.

%X Educators have developed an effective technique to get feedback after
in-person lectures, called "muddy cards." Students are given time to reflect
and write the "muddiest" (least clear) point on an index card, to hand in as
they leave class. This practice of assigning end-of-lecture reflection tasks to
generate explicit student feedback is well suited for adaptation to the
challenge of supporting feedback in online video lectures. We describe the
design and evaluation of Mudslide, a prototype system that translates the
practice of muddy cards into the realm of online lecture videos. Based on an
in-lab study of students and teachers, we find that spatially contextualizing
students' muddy point feedback with respect to particular lecture slides is
advantageous to both students and teachers. We also reflect on further
opportunities for enhancing this feedback method based on teachers' and
students' experiences with our prototype.

%X Tutorial videos are widely available to help people use software. These
videos, however, are viewed by users as captured and offer little direct
interaction between users and software. This paper presents a video navigation
method that allows users to interact with software tutorial video as if they
were using the software. To make the tutorial video responsive, our method
records the user interaction events like mouse click and drag during capturing
the video. Our method then analyzes, selects, and visualizes these user
interaction events at the event locations. When a user directly interacts with
an event visualization, our method automatically navigates to the proper video
frame to provide the visual feedback as if the software were responding to the
user input. Thus, our method provides the experience of interacting with the
software through directly manipulating the tutorial video. Our study shows our
method can better help users follow tutorial videos to complete tasks than the
baseline timeline interface.

provide both mental and physical stimulation for older adults in residential
care. However, little research has explored the practical challenges and
opportunities that arise from integrating these games within existing schedules
of activities in these contexts. In our work, we report on a qualitative

that games can be a valuable means of re-introducing challenge in late life,
but that the impact of age-related changes and impairment can influence
people's ability to engage with games in a group setting. We outline core
challenges in the design for care context and discuss implications of our work
regarding the suitability of games as a self-directed leisure activity.

accomplish frequently-recurring high-level goals with IT products.
Customization can be done either locally or remotely. We conducted an
experiment to compare the CoFa&ccedil;ade approach with a baseline approach
where helpers taught elders to perform IT tasks. Our results showed that
CoFa&ccedil;ade can reduce helpers' time and effort, reduce elders'
frustration, and improve elders' success rate in completing IT tasks.

in developed countries, providing design opportunities and challenges for HCI.
Since the recruitment of oldest old people is challenging, research tends to
focus on older adults (65+) and their use of and attitudes towards existing
communication technologies, or on their caregivers and social ties. Our study
deployed a novel communication appliance among five frail oldest old people
living in a long-term care facility, which included field observations and
usability and accessibility tests. Our findings suggest factors that facilitate
and hinder the adoption of communication technologies, such as social,
attitudinal, digital literacy, physical, and usability. We also discuss issues
that arise in studying technology adoption by the oldest old, including
usability and accessibility testing, and suggest solutions that may be helpful

%X Crowdsourcing is a relatively new model of labor where both the workers and
work providers are experiencing its growing pains. A dominant platform that
implements this model of labor is Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). While AMT has
evolved over the years, the changes have focused mainly on work providers and
have not addressed the problems workers face (e.g. dealing with market
volatility and unpaid time searching for work). In this paper we present
TurkBench, a tool meant to provide workers with personalized market
visualization and session management. We discuss the design philosophy of the
tool, briefly discuss four Turkers' reaction to a demo, and outline future

%X Websites can record individual users' activities and display them in a
variety of ways. There is a tradeoff between detail and abstraction in
visualization, especially when the amount of content increases and becomes more
difficult to process. We conducted an experiment on Mechanical Turk varying the
quality, detail, and visual presentation of information about an individual's
past work to see how these design features affected perceptions of the worker.
We found that providing detail in the display through text increased processing
time and led to less positive evaluations. Visually abstract displays required
less processing time but decreased confidence in evaluation. This suggests that
different design parameters may engender differing psychological processes that
influence reactions towards an unknown person.

%X By lowering the costs of communication, the web promises to enable
distributed collectives to act around shared issues. However, many collective
action efforts never succeed: while the web's affordances make it easy to
gather, these same decentralizing characteristics impede any focus towards
action. In this paper, we study challenges to collective action efforts through
the lens of online labor by engaging with Amazon Mechanical Turk workers.
Through a year of ethnographic fieldwork, we sought to understand online
workers' unique barriers to collective action. We then created Dynamo, a
platform to support the Mechanical Turk community in forming publics around
issues and then mobilizing. We found that collective action publics tread a
precariously narrow path between the twin perils of stalling and friction,
balancing with each step between losing momentum and flaring into acrimony.
However, specially structured labor to maintain efforts' forward motion can
help such publics take action.

requiring human intelligence. With the ever-growing worker base that aims to
complete microtasks on crowdsourcing platforms in exchange for financial gains,
there is a need for stringent mechanisms to prevent exploitation of deployed
tasks. Quality control mechanisms need to accommodate a diverse pool of
workers, exhibiting a wide range of behavior. A pivotal step towards
fraud-proof task design is understanding the behavioral patterns of microtask
workers. In this paper, we analyze the prevalent malicious activity on
crowdsourcing platforms and study the behavior exhibited by trustworthy and
untrustworthy workers, particularly on crowdsourced surveys. Based on our
analysis of the typical malicious activity, we define and identify different
types of workers in the crowd, propose a method to measure malicious activity,
and finally present guidelines for the efficient design of crowdsourced
surveys.

%X Billions of people use cloud-based storage for personal files. While many
are likely aware of the extent to which they store information in the cloud, it
is unclear whether users are fully aware of what they are storing online. We
recruited 30 research subjects from Craigslist to investigate how users
interact with and understand the privacy issues of cloud storage. We studied
this phenomenon through surveys, an interview, and custom software which lets
users see and delete their photos stored in the cloud. We found that a majority
of users stored private photos in the cloud that they did not intend to upload,
and a large portion also chose to permanently delete some of the offending
images. We believe our study highlights a mismatch between user expectation and
reality. As cloud storage is plentiful and ubiquitous, effective tools for
enabling risk self-assessment are necessary to protect users' privacy.

%X While media reports about wearable cameras have focused on the privacy
concerns of bystanders, the perspectives of the 'lifeloggers' themselves have
not been adequately studied. We report on additional analysis of our previous
in-situ lifelogging study in which 36 participants wore a camera for a week and
then reviewed the images to specify privacy and sharing preferences. In this
Note, we analyze the photos themselves, seeking to understand what makes a
photo private, what participants said about their images, and what we can learn
about privacy in this new and very different context where photos are captured
automatically by one's wearable camera. We find that these devices record many
moments that may not be captured by traditional (deliberate) photography, with
camera owners concerned about impression management and protecting private
information of both themselves and bystanders.

%X Most laptops and personal computers have webcams with LED indicators to
notify users when they are recording. Because hackers use surreptitiously
captured webcam recordings to extort users, we explored the effectiveness of
these indicators under varying circumstances and how they could be improved. We
observed that, on average, fewer than half of our participants (45%) noticed
the existing indicator during computer-based tasks. When seated in front of the
computer performing a paper-based task, only 5% noticed the indicator. We
performed a followup experiment to evaluate a new indicator and observed that
adding onscreen glyphs had a significant impact on both computer-based and
non-computer-based tasks (93% and 59% noticed the new indicator, respectively).
We discuss how our results can be integrated into current systems, as well as
future ubiquitous computing systems.

%X A home away from home, the pub is synonymous with good conversation. Yet,
the art of conversation in pubs is changing with the ubiquity of mobile phones.
We present a qualitative study spanning over three years describing experiences
and rhetoric surrounding the relationship that mobiles have and should have
with our conversation in the pub. We found that mobile phones are able to
enhance conversation but can also cause a disruption to the informal and adhoc
nature of pubs. The use of Facebook on mobile phones has also changed pubs from
what Oldenburg terms a third space to a space that is potentially being
surveilled. We suggest future designs should not necessarily discourage or
encourage mobile use in pubs, but rather provoke us into reflecting on how
intertwined modern conversation is with mobile technology in the context of the
pub space.

constantly accept input via audio and video channels: kiosks that determine
demographic information of passersby, gesture controlled home entertainment
systems and audio controlled wearable devices are just a few examples. To
enforce the principle of least privilege, recent proposals have suggested
technical approaches to limit third-party applications to receiving only the
data they need, rather than entire audio or video streams. For users to make
informed privacy decisions, applications will still need to communicate what
data they are accessing and indicators will be needed to communicate this
information. We performed several crowdsourcing experiments to examine how
potential users might conceptualize and understand privacy indicators on
ubiquitous sensing platforms.

%X Blood pressure (BP) is typically captured at irregular intervals, mostly in
clinic environments. This approach treats BP as a static snapshot for health
classification and largely ignores its value as a continuously fluctuating
measure. Recognizing that consumers are increasingly capturing health metrics
through wearable devices, we explored BP measurement in relation to everyday
living through a two-week field study with 34 adults. Based on questionnaires,
measurement logs, and interviews, we examined participants' perceptions and
attitudes towards BP variability and their associations of BP with aspects of
their lives. We found that participants modified their use of BP devices in
response to BP variability, made associations with stress, food, and daily
routines, and revealed challenges with the design of current BP devices for
personal use. We present design recommendations for BP use in everyday contexts
and describe strategies for reframing BP capture and reporting.

%X Adults with Type 1 Diabetes have choices regarding the technology they use
to self-manage their chronic condition. They can use glucose meters, insulin
pumps, smartphone apps, and other technologies to support their everyday care.
However, little is known about how their social lives might influence what they
adopt or how they use technologies. A multi-method study was conducted to
examine contextual factors that influence their technology use. While
individual differences play a large role in everyday use, social factors were
also found to influence use. For example, people can hide their devices in
uncertain social situations or show them off to achieve a purpose. We frame
these social behaviours using Goffman's theatre metaphor of onstage and
offstage behaviour, and discuss how this kind of analysis can inform the design
of future mobile medical devices for self-management of chronic conditions.

%X Finding ways to help people quit smoking is a high priority in health
behavior change research. Recent HCI studies involving technologies using
specific quitting techniques such as social support and SMS messaging to help
people quit have reported some success. Early studies using computer generated
print material report significant success of tailored versus non-tailored
material, however, there is limited understanding on what aspects of digitally
delivered quitting assistance should be tailored and how. To address this, we
have conducted an empirical investigation with smokers to identify perceived
importance of different types of help when quitting and the potential role of
technology in providing such help. We found that people are highly individual
in their approach to quitting and the kind of help they regard as relevant to
their situation. Our contribution is a collection of empirically derived themes
for tailoring smoking cessation apps to individual quitting needs.

%X Breastfeeding is positively encouraged across many countries as a public
health endeavour. The World Health Organisation recommends breastfeeding
exclusively for the first six months of an infant's life. However, women can
struggle to breastfeed, and to persist with breastfeeding, for a number of
reasons from technique to social acceptance. This paper reports on four phases
of a design and research project, from sensitising user-engagement and
user-centred design, to the development and in-the-wild deployment of a mobile
phone application called FeedFinder. FeedFinder has been developed with
breastfeeding women to support them in finding, reviewing and sharing public
breastfeeding places with other breastfeeding women. We discuss how mobile
technologies can be designed to support public health endeavours, and suggest
that public health technologies are better aimed at communities and societies
rather than individual.

%X Research indicates that the facial expressions of animated characters and
agents can influence people's perceptions and interactions with these entities.
We designed an experiment to examine how an interactive animated avatar's
facial expressiveness influences dyadic conversations between adults and the
avatar. We animated the avatar in realtime using the tracked facial motion of a
confederate. To adjust facial expressiveness, we damped and exaggerated the
avatar's facial motion. We found that ratings of the avatar's extroversion were
positively related to its expressiveness. However, impressions of the avatar's
realism and naturalness worsened with increased expressiveness. We also found
that the confederate was more influential when she appeared as the damped or
exaggerated avatar. Adjusting the expressiveness of interactive animated
avatars may be a simple way to influence people's social judgments and
willingness to collaborate with animated avatars. These results have
implications for using avatar facial expressiveness to improve the
effectiveness of avatars in various contexts. Adjusting the expressiveness of
interactive animated avatars may be a simple way to influence people's social
judgments and willingness to collaborate with animated avatars.

%X A long-standing challenge of video-mediated communication systems is to
correctly represent remote participant gaze direction in local environments. A
telepresence robot with a movable display that shows the face of a remote
participant is a promising approach for solving this issue. Researchers
generally consider that display orientation is effective for local participants
to properly estimate the gaze direction of remote participants. We investigate
how subjects estimate gaze direction of a remote participant ("Looker") when
his/her face is displayed on a rotatable flat display. Our experiment reveals
that both the Looker's head-eye rotation in the display and display rotation
affect subject estimation, but the effect of the display rotation is relatively
small. Furthermore, we reveal that subjects tend to overestimate Looker gaze
direction. Based on our results, we propose a design implication for a
telepresence robot to reduce overestimation and properly represent the remote
participant gaze direction.

design of the system was informed by an analysis of TED talks given by two
human presenters to identify the most common dual-presentation formats and
transition behaviors used. In a within-subjects study (N=12) comparing
co-presenting with DynamicDuo against solo-presenting with conventional
presentation software, we demonstrated that our system led to significant
improvements in public speaking anxiety and speaking confidence for non-native
English speakers. Judges who viewed videotapes of these presentations rated
those with DynamicDuo significantly higher on speech quality and overall
presentation quality for all presenters.

%X As we increasingly strive for scientific rigor and generalizability in HCI
research, should we entertain any hope that by doing good science, our
discoveries will eventually be more transferrable to industry? We present an
in-depth case study of how an HCI research innovation goes through the process
of transitioning from a university project to a revenue-generating startup
financed by venture capital. The innovation is a novel contextual help system
for the Web, and we reflect on the different methods used to evaluate it and
how research insights endure attempted dissemination as a commercial product.
Although the extent to which any innovation succeeds commercially depends on a
number of factors like market forces, we found that our HCI innovation with
user-centered origins was in a unique position to gain traction with customers
and garner buy-in from investors. However, since end users were not the buyers
of our product, a strong user-centered focus obfuscated other critical needs of
the startup and pushed out perspectives of non-user-centered stakeholders. To
make the research-to-product transition, we had to focus on adoption-centered
design, the process of understanding and designing for adopters and
stakeholders of the product. Our case study raises questions about how we
evaluate the novelty and research contributions of HCI innovations with respect
to their potential for commercial impact.

research and design efforts, including those dedicated to the development of
new collaborative infrastructures in the sciences. Building on several years of
ethnographic fieldwork, this paper examines standardization efforts attached to
new forms of design and computational development in American ecology. We
explore the role that standards play in large-scale research networks; how
standards are enacted and enforced in complex interactive systems like science;
how standards struggle and fail (and what happens when they do); and how actors
work across the gaps that standards leave to produce more effective forms of
practice and design. We also argue for the potentially creative role of
standards, including contexts in which they function as fulcrums for change and
innovation. We conclude with reflections on how HCI researchers might rethink
the nature and possibilities of standards and standardization in their own
work.

%X Skin-based input has become an increasingly viable interaction model for
user interfaces, however it has yet to be explored outside the domain of mobile
computing. In this paper, we examine skin as an interactive input surface for
gestural 3D modeling-to-fabrication systems. When used as both the input
surface and base canvas for digital design, skin-input can enable non-experts
users to intuitively create precise forms around highly complex physical
contexts: our own bodies. In this paper, we outline design considerations when
creating interfaces for such systems. We then discuss interaction techniques
for three different modes of skin-centric modeling: direct, parametric, and
generative. We also present Tactum, a new fabrication-aware design system that
captures a user's skin-centric gestures for 3D modeling directly on the body.
Lastly, we show sample artifacts generated with our system, and share a set of
observations from design professionals.

%X We present a new type of 3D printer that can form precise, but soft and
deformable 3D objects from layers of off-the-shelf fabric. Our printer employs
an approach where a sheet of fabric forms each layer of a 3D object. The
printer cuts this sheet along the 2D contour of the layer using a laser cutter
and then bonds it to previously printed layers using a heat sensitive adhesive.
Surrounding fabric in each layer is temporarily retained to provide a removable
support structure for layers printed above it. This process is repeated to
build up a 3D object layer by layer. Our printer is capable of automatically
feeding two separate fabric types into a single print. This allows specially
cut layers of conductive fabric to be embedded in our soft prints. Using this
capability we demonstrate 3D models with touch sensing capability built into a
soft print in one complete printing process, and a simple LED display making
use of a conductive fabric coil for wireless power reception.

%X This paper presents Platener, a system that allows quickly fabricating
intermediate design iterations of 3D models, a process also known as
low-fidelity fabrication. Platener achieves its speed-up by extracting straight
and curved plates from the 3D model and substituting them with laser cut parts
of the same size and thickness. Only the regions that are of relevance to the
current design iteration are executed as full-detail 3D prints. Platener
connects the parts it has created by automatically inserting joints. To help
fast assembly it engraves instructions. Platener allows users to customize
substitution results by (1) specifying fidelity-speed tradeoffs, (2) choosing
whether or not to convert curved surfaces to plates bent using heat, and (3)
specifying the conversion of individual plates and joints interactively.
Platener is designed to best preserve the fidelity of functional objects, such
as casings and mechanical tools, all of which contain a large percentage of
straight/rectilinear elements. Compared to other low-fab systems, such as
faBrickator and WirePrint, Platener better preserves the stability and
functionality of such objects: the resulting assemblies have fewer parts and
the parts have the same size and thickness as in the 3D model. To validate our
system, we converted 2.250 3D models downloaded from a 3D model site
(Thingiverse). Platener achieves a speed-up of 10 or more for 39.5% of all
objects.

%X We introduce D-Coil, a new digital 3D modeling approach using wax coiling to
bring tangibility to the design of digital models. After defining a shape to
extrude, the users follow the lead of a hand-held actuated extruder to
instantiate the actual extrusion using wax. The tangibility of the wax
extrusion sets the stage to create the next components until the digital model
is completed. The digital model affords all digital attributes (ease of
transformation, distribution, and 3D printing) while the wax artifact can be
discarded or kept as a one-of-a-kind memento. We present a proof-of-concept
implementation of D-Coil and showcase how this additive approach can also be
extended to a subtractive process using a digitally actuated cutter. By adding
a 6DOF mouse, users can also include scaling, rotation, and bending effects to
create a wide variety of shapes often difficult for novices to produce in
standard CAD software.

%X Edge targets, such as buttons or menus along the edge of a screen, are known
to afford fast acquisition performance in desktop mousing environments. As the
popularity of touch-based devices continues to grow, understanding the
affordances of edge targets on touchscreen is needed. This paper describes
results from two controlled experiments that examine in detail the effect of
edge targets on performance in touch devices. The results show that on touch
devices, a target's proximity to the edge may have a significant negative
effect on reaction time. We examine the effect in detail and explore mitigating
factors. We discuss potential explanations for the effect and propose
implications for the design of efficient interfaces for touch devices.

%X We present FlickBoard, which combines a touchpad and a keyboard into the
same interaction area to reduce hand movement between a separate keyboard and
touchpad. Our main contribution is automatic mode switching between typing and
pointing, and the first system capable of combining a trackpad and a keyboard
into an single interaction area without the need for external switches. We
developed a prototype by embedding a 58x20 capacitive sensing grid into a soft
keyboard cover, and used machine learning to distinguish between moving a
cursor (touchpad mode) and entering text (keyboard mode). We conducted
experimental studies that show automatic mode switching classification
accuracies of 98% are achievable with our technology. Finally, our prototype
has a thin profile and can be placed over existing keyboards.

%X In this study, we propose a striped pattern sticker called ExtensionSticker
that allows a touch input to be transferred from an external source by simply
attaching the sticker to a touch panel. This allows the user to input touches
or continuous scrolling actions by touching a sticker printed with stripes of
conductive ink, without directly touching the touch panel. This method could be
applied to the sides or back of a touch panel, or even the surface upon which a
device is located as a touch interface, allowing us to freely construct
interfaces in shapes matching the demands of the user. This paper also reports
the results of evaluation experiments conducted to assess the recognition
accuracy of scroll and tap actions using the proposed method.

%X Personal cloud services such as Dropbox are used increasingly to support
collaborative work, even though they typically have poor support for tracking
files and users' activities and collaborators often rely on other communication
channels to be notified of changes. We present a meta-cloud storage service,
MUBox, that, independent of a particular cloud storage service, provides
improved support for collaboration. First, users can switch to activity views
that list user activities rather than files, which is an example of an
increasingly available feature in popular cloud storage clients. Second, MUBox
introduces multi-user aware folder views that embed information on the last
changes performed by collaborators. These folder views are enhanced based on a
new concept of shadow files which act as placeholders for files that have been
moved or renamed. A user study (N=16) with realistic folder exploration tasks
shows that activity views have a significant effect on the accuracy and
confidence of users in workspace awareness tasks, while shadow files
significantly improve the speed, accuracy and confidence of users in
traceability tasks. We describe how existing services could implement these
features as well as a new concept for voting on changes to shared folders that
could improve asynchronous collaboration.

were made to comments from them, and to researchers interested in the new

%X Personal communication between User-Centered Design (UCD) specialists and
developers is important for communicating user needs and design solutions in
agile development. In distributed projects where opportunities for personal
communication are limited, the design documentation is an important surrogate.
This study has investigated the perceived effectiveness of boundary objects in
a distributed agile team, and their role in communicating target user needs.
Six in-depth interviews with UCD specialists showed that the boundary objects
rarely communicate underlying needs of the users but rather focus on
interaction with the system that is being developed. The used boundary objects
also do not work as stand-alone deliverables; they need to be explained and
elaborated. Making the boundary objects comprehensive enough to be stand-alone
is seen as too time consuming and not worth the effort. For agile projects with
distributed teams, this creates hand-over and follow-up problems.

score based on various recordable driving-related events like abrupt braking or
irregular turning actions. Our qualitative methodology incorporated
semi-structured interviews and ethnographic fieldwork, in order to explore
drivers' attitudes towards the system and its effect on driving behaviour and
working conditions. Our findings illustrate how bus operators simultaneously
accommodate and resist the demands Drivewell places upon them. Our work also
demonstrates how this digital intervention acts in conjunction with other
driver-related technologies, creating a unique digital ecosystem on the modern
London bus. Our research contributes to HCI understandings of digital

%X While extensive research has investigated the risks of children sharing
their personal information online, little work has investigated the
implications of parents sharing personal information about their children
online. Drawing on 102 interviews with parents in the U.S., we investigate how
parents decide what to disclose about their children on social network sites
(SNSs). We find that mothers take on the responsibility of sharing content
about their children more than fathers do. Fathers are more restrictive about
sharing to broad and professional audiences and are concerned about sharing
content that could be perceived as sexually suggestive. Both mothers and
fathers work to leverage affordances of SNSs to limit oversharing. Building on
prior work, we explore parental disclosure management, which describes how
parents decide what to share about their children online. We also describe an
emerging third shift of work that highlights the additional work parents take
on to manage children's identities online. We conclude with theoretical and
practical implications for designing SNSs to better support family life online.

%X Fathers are taking on more childcare and household responsibilities than
they used to and many non-profit and government organizations have pushed for
changes in policies to support fathers. Despite this effort, little research
has explored how fathers go online related to their roles as fathers. Drawing
on an interview study with 37 fathers, we find that they use social media to
document and archive fatherhood, learn how to be a father, and access social
support. They also go online to support diverse family needs, such as single
fathers' use of Reddit instead of Facebook, fathers raised by single mothers'
search for role models online, and stay-at-home fathers' use of father blogs.
However, fathers are constrained by privacy concerns and perceptions of
judgment relating to sharing content online about their children. Drawing on
theories of fatherhood, we present theoretical and design ideas for designing
online spaces to better support fathers and fatherhood. We conclude with a call
for a research agenda to support fathers online.

three. While few children in that age range used computers before the advent of
smartphones and tablets, these devices have made computers much more accessible
to infants and toddlers. In this paper, we provide a window into how these
children are using tablets through an analysis of relevant YouTube videos. A
majority of children aged 12 to 17 months in the videos in our dataset showed
at least moderate ability to use the tablets. For children aged two, it was
over 90 percent who displayed at least moderate ability. Our analysis also
includes trends in interaction styles, child and device positioning, social
aspects, and app genres. These findings point both to opportunities for
research and starting points for design.

%X Prototyping allows designers to quickly iterate and gather feedback, but the
time it takes to create even a Wizard-of-Oz prototype reduces the utility of
the process. In this paper, we introduce crowdsourcing techniques and tools for
prototyping interactive systems in the time it takes to describe the idea. Our
Apparition system uses paid microtask crowds to make even hard-to-automate
functions work immediately, allowing more fluid prototyping of interfaces that
contain interactive elements and complex behaviors. As users sketch their
interface and describe it aloud in natural language, crowd workers and sketch
recognition algorithms translate the input into user interface elements, add
animations, and provide Wizard-of-Oz functionality. We discuss how design teams
can use our approach to reflect on prototypes or begin user studies within
seconds, and how, over time, Apparition prototypes can become fully-implemented
versions of the systems they simulate. Powering Apparition is the first
self-coordinated, real-time crowdsourcing infrastructure. We anchor this
infrastructure on a new, lightweight write-locking mechanism that workers can
use to signal their intentions to each other.

%X The promise of "smart" homes, workplaces, schools, and other environments
has long been championed. Unattractive, however, has been the cost to run wires
and install sensors. More critically, raw sensor data tends not to align with
the types of questions humans wish to ask, e.g., do I need to restock my
pantry? Although techniques like computer vision can answer some of these
questions, it requires significant effort to build and train appropriate
classifiers. Even then, these systems are often brittle, with limited ability
to handle new or unexpected situations, including being repositioned and
environmental changes (e.g., lighting, furniture, seasons). We propose Zensors,
a new sensing approach that fuses real-time human intelligence from online
crowd workers with automatic approaches to provide robust, adaptive, and
readily deployable intelligent sensors. With Zensors, users can go from
question to live sensor feed in less than 60 seconds. Through our API, Zensors
can enable a variety of rich end-user applications and moves us closer to the
vision of responsive, intelligent environments.

%X Coding behavioral video is an important method used by researchers to
understand social phenomenon. Unfortunately, traditional hand-coding approaches
can take days or weeks of time to complete. Recent work has shown that these
tasks can be completed quickly by leveraging the parallelism of large online
crowds, but using the crowd introduces new concerns about accuracy,
reliability, privacy, and cost. To explore these issues, we conducted
interviews with 12 researchers who frequently code behavioral video, to
investigate common practices and challenges with video coding. We find accuracy
and privacy to be the researchers' primary concerns. To explore this more
concretely, we used sample videos to investigate whether crowds can accurately
recognize instances of commonly coded behaviors, and show that the crowd yields
accurate results. Then, we demonstrate a method for obfuscating participant
identity with a video blur filter, and find, as expected, that workers' ability
to identify participants decreases as blur level increases. The workers'
ability to accurately and reliably code behaviors also decreases, but not as
steeply as the identity test. This trade-off between coding quality and privacy
protection suggests that researchers can use online crowds to code for some key
behaviors in video without compromising participant identity. We conclude with
a discussion of how researchers can balance privacy and accuracy on their own
data using a system we introduce called Incognito.

%X Games with a Purpose (GWAP) is a popular approach for metadata creation,
enabling institutions to collect descriptions of digital artifacts on a mass
scale. Creating metadata is challenging not only because one must recognize the
artifact; the description must then be encoded into natural language. Language
behaviors are influenced by many social factors, particularly when we are asked
to describe other people. We consider labels for images of people generated via
the ESP Game. While ESP has been shown to produce relevant labels, critics
claim they are obvious and stereotypical. Based on theories of linguistic
biases, we examine whether there are systematic differences in the ways players
describe images of men versus women. Our first analysis considers images of
people generally, and reveals a tendency for women to be described with
subjective adjectives. A second analysis compares images depicting men and
women within each of six occupational roles. Images of women receive more
labels related to appearance, whereas those depicting men receive more
occupation-related labels. Our work exposes the presence of gender-based
stereotypes through linguistic biases, illustrates the forms in which they
manifest, and raises important implications for those who design systems or
train algorithms using data produced via GWAP.

%X In many parts of the world, the electricity supply industry makes the task
of dealing with unpredictable spikes and dips in production and demand
invisible to consumers, maintaining a seemingly unlimited supply. A future
increase in reliance on time-variable renewable sources of electricity may lead
to greater fluctuations in supply. We engaged remote islanders as equal
partners in a research project that investigated through technology-mediated
enquiry the topic of synchronising energy consumption with supply, and together
built a prototype renewable energy forecast display. A number of participants
described a change in their practices, saving high energy tasks for times when
local renewable energy was expected to be available, despite having no
financial incentive to do so. The main contributions of this paper are in: 1)
the results of co-development sessions exploring systems supporting
synchronising consumption with supply and 2) the findings arising from the
deployment of the prototype.

%X When it comes to environmental sustainability, the time that electricity is
consumed matters. For example, using an air conditioner on a hot summer
afternoon as the power grid is strained necessitates the use of more polluting
sources to meet demand. In this paper, we analyze end-user response to two
utility-driven conservation programs in Ontario, Canada: Time-of-Use pricing
and the peaksaver program. We find that time-of-use pricing encourages shifting
some electricity demand, but only when it is convenient. We also find that
while potentially effective at a larger scale, the peaksaver program in its
current form is unattractive to participants. These results are discussed in
the context of Fogg's Behavior Model for Persuasive Design, which allows us to
explore the design space for improvement to these programs and ground our
design implications for the design of technologies to encourage reduction of
peak electricity demand.

%X Over the past decade we have seen an increased awareness about domestic
energy consumption and a growing focus on eco-feedback displays. In this paper
we explore the concept of providing forecasts in such displays as a supplement
to information about past usage. Our prototype, eForecast, extends the display
of past electricity usage with forecasts about expected usage, electricity
price, availability of wind power, and expected demand drops and peaks.
Building on previous eco-feedback display research, our approach specifically
enables people to use electricity at more opportune times -- when it is cheap,
green, or when there is an abundance of capacity. We evaluated eForecast in
real world use in three domestic households for 22 weeks, where we explored
potentials and limitations of forecasting for shifting electricity consumption.
In this way, families were able to act in a more sustainable way -- without
necessarily reducing the amount of electricity consumed.

addition of online controls in the feedback intervention led to more energy
savings than feedback only and worked better for light and phone usage than
computer and monitor usage. The addition of automated control led to the
greatest savings but was less effective for efficient users than inefficient
ones.

%X The building sector accounts for 41% of primary energy consumption in the
US, contributing an increasing portion of the country's carbon dioxide
emissions. With recent sensor improvements and falling costs, auditors are
increasingly using thermography-infrared (IR) cameras-to detect thermal defects
and analyze building efficiency. Research in automated thermography has grown
commensurately, aimed at reducing manual labor and improving thermal models.
Though promising, we could find no prior work exploring the professional
auditor's perspectives of thermography or reactions to emerging automation. To
address this gap, we present results from two studies: a semi-structured
interview with 10 professional energy auditors, which includes design probes of
five automated thermography scenarios, and an observational case study of a
residential audit. We report on common perspectives, concerns, and benefits
related to thermography and summarize reactions to our automated scenarios. Our
findings have implications for thermography tool designers as well as
researchers working on automated solutions in robotics, computer science, and
engineering.

individual handball training, called "The Bouncer", and the design process
behind three training games. In order to investigate how game elements can
affect the training experience, we conducted a study with 10 experienced
amateur handball players, eliciting responses regarding the training relevance
of the games. Based on the study and our design insights, we propose three
challenges that designers of interactive sports-training games need to
consider: 1) Maintaining relevance when translating physical elements into
digital representations. 2) Choosing an appropriate level of sensing as game
input. 3) Introducing points in training exercises without reducing sport
relevance. For the three challenges, we propose strategies to help future
designers of training games.

%X Motivation studies on running are often focused on how to convince
non-runners to run, mainly through designing for extrinsic motivations such as
health concerns or external reward systems. In contrast, we conducted a
structured inquiry into understanding how to design technology for those whom
are already committed to running and participate in organized races. Through
interviews, focus groups, ethnographic observation, questionnaires, and
design-based research over the course of two years, we investigated the needs
of the advanced amateur runner community. An analysis of the gathered data led
to five design themes -- Festival, Competition, Practicalities, Togetherness,
and Support -- to inform future runner motivation technology. While flow theory
appears to be a convenient tool to understand support during a race, we
observed a number of other factors that need to be considered. Through
combining the themes with previous research, we conclude by presenting nine
guidelines for designing technology for this domain.

%X Jogging is a popular exertion activity. The abundance of jogging apps
suggests to us that joggers can appreciate the opportunity for technology to
support the jogging experience. We want to take this investigation a step
further by exploring if, and how, robotic systems can support the jogging
experience. We designed and built a flying robotic system, a quadcopter, as a
jogging companion and studied its use with 13 individual joggers. By analyzing
their experiences, we derived three design dimensions that describe a design
space for flying robotic jogging companions: Perceived Control, Focus and
Bodily Interaction. Additionally, we articulate a series of design tactics,
described by these dimensions, to guide the design of future systems. With this
work we hope to inspire and guide designers interested in creating robotic
systems to support exertion experiences.

%X Today, sports and activity trackers are ubiquitous. Especially runners and
cyclists have a variety of possibilities to record and analyze their workouts.
In contrast, climbing did not find much attention in consumer electronics and
human-computer interaction. If quantified data similar to cycling or running
data were available for climbing, several applications would be possible,
ranging from simple training diaries to virtual coaches or usage analytics for
gym operators. This paper introduces a system that automatically recognizes
climbed routes using wrist-worn inertia measurement units (IMUs). This is
achieved by extracting features of a recorded ascent and use them as training
data for the recognition system. To verify the recognition system,
cross-validation methods were applied to a set of ascent recordings that were
assessed during a user study with eight climbers in a local climbing gym. The
evaluation resulted in a high recognition rate, thus proving that our approach
is possible and operational.

%X We explored how emotional cues presented in visual and haptic modalities
interact. We constructed an affective haptic dataset, and used the emotional
visual stimuli from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS).
Participants were asked to rate the visual stimuli, haptic stimuli and
visualhaptic stimuli. Analysis of the results indicates that the presence of
haptic stimulus affects the arousal of the visual stimulus, but does not affect
the valence significantly. We further explored this interaction in terms of the
intensity, frequency, waveform and rhythm of the haptic stimuli. We then
provide a set of guidelines on visual-haptic interaction that could be used in
design of multimodal affective feedback.

%X Touch is a powerful vehicle for communication between humans. The way we
touch (how) embraces and mediates certain emotions such as anger, joy, fear, or
love. While this phenomenon is well explored for human interaction, HCI
research is only starting to uncover the fine granularity of sensory
stimulation and responses in relation to certain emotions. Within this paper we
present the findings from a study exploring the communication of emotions
through a haptic system that uses tactile stimulation in mid-air. Here, haptic
descriptions for specific emotions (e.g., happy, sad, excited, afraid) were
created by one group of users to then be reviewed and validated by two other
groups of users. We demonstrate the non-arbitrary mapping between emotions and
haptic descriptions across three groups. This points to the huge potential for
mediating emotions through mid-air haptics. We discuss specific design
implications based on the spatial, directional, and haptic parameters of the
created haptic descriptions and illustrate their design potential for HCI based
on two design ideas.

%X Research has shown that thermal feedback can be an engaging and convincing
means of conveying experimenter-predefined meanings, e.g., material properties
or message types. However, thermal perception is subjective and its meaning in
interaction can be ambiguous. Interface designers may not be sure how users
could na&iuml;vely interpret thermal feedback during interaction. Little is
also known about how users would choose thermal cues to convey their own
meanings. The research in this paper tested subjective interpretations of
thermal stimuli in three different scenarios: social media activity, a
colleague's presence and the extent of use of digital content. Participants
were also asked to assign their own thermal stimuli to personal experiences, to
help us understand what kinds of stimuli people associate with different
meanings. The results showed strong agreement among participants concerning
what warmth (presence, activity, quality) and cool mean (absence, poor
quality). Guidelines for the design of thermal feedback are presented to help
others create effective thermal interfaces.

%X Interacting with nature is beneficial to a person's mental-state, but it can
sometimes be difficult to find environments that will induce positive affect
(e.g., when planning a run). In this paper, we describe EnviroPulse -- a system
for automatically determining and communicating the expected affective valence
(EAV) of environments to individuals. We describe a prototype that allows this
to be used in real-time on a smartphone, but EnviroPulse could easily be
incorporated into GPS systems, mapping services, or image-based systems. Our
work differs from existing work in affective computing in that, rather than
detecting a user's affect directly, we automatically determine the EAV of the
environment through visual analysis. We present results that suggest our system
can determine the EAV of environments. We also introduce real-time affective
visual feedback of the calculated EAV of the images, and present results from
an informal study suggesting that real-time visual feedback can be used for
induction of affect.

%X The term 'critical design' is on the upswing in HCI. We analyze how
discourses around 'critical design' are diverging in Design and HCI. We argue
that this divergence undermines HCI's ability to learn from and appropriate the
design approaches signaled by this term. Instead, we articulate two ways to
broaden and deepen connections between Design and HCI: (1) develop a broader
collective understanding of what these design approaches can be, without
forcing them to be about 'criticality' or 'critical design,' narrowly
construed; and (2) shape a variation of design criticism to better meet Design
practices, terms, and ways of knowing.

%X The paper offers theoretical support for research through design (RtD) by
arguing that in order to legitimize and make use of research through design as
research, HCI researchers need to explore and clarify how RtD objects might
contribute to knowledge. Leveraging the tradition of aesthetics in the arts and
humanities, we argue that while the intentions of the object's designer are
important and while annotations are a good mechanism to articulate them, the
critical reception of objects is equally foundational to RtD's broader
knowledge impacts within HCI. Such a scholarly critical reception is needed
precisely because of the potential inexhaustibility of design objects'
meanings; their inability to be paraphrased simply and adequately. Offering a
multilevel analysis of the (critical) design fiction Menstruation Machine by
Sputniko!, the paper explores how design objects co-produce knowledge, by
working through complex design problem spaces in non-reductive ways, proposing
new connections and distinctions, and embodying design ideas and processes
across time and minds.

include using the Obscura 1C to articulate the concepts of inhibitive
interfaces, counterfunctionality, and enabling limitations. The Obscura 1C is
further used to articulate how abstract ideas can be translated into material
forms, to rethink the role of packaging in user studies, and to draw attention
to how discursive design objects are packaged and presented.

communication. Accordingly, adopting pause moment design for the SNS domain
becomes significant, considering its worth for mental well-being and diversity
of experience. Nonetheless, the vision is currently controversial, as it is
lacking in attempts to examine the worth of pause moment design for SNS
communication. Therefore, we discussed the benefits of pause moment design as
an SNS application, based on the case of Ripening Room. From observation, we
have identified three benefits of pause moment design; preserving room for
solitude, expanding time experience, and providing additional indirect cues for
communication. Nevertheless, the benefits also imply limitations of the current
design, thus require following attempts to adopt a pause moment design for the
SNS domain.

industrial applications warrant a thorough understanding of its advantages and
drawbacks through empirical evidence. We conducted an experiment to investigate
what characteristics of eye-wearable technology impact user performance in
machine maintenance, which included a representative set of car maintenance
tasks involving Locate, Manipulate, and Compare actions. Participants were
asked to follow instructions displayed on one of four technologies: a
peripheral eye-wearable display, a central eye-wearable display, a tablet, or a
paper manual. We found a significant effect of display position: the peripheral
eye-wearable display resulted in longer completion time than the central
display; but no effect for hands-free operation. The technology effects were
also modulated by different Tasks and Action types. We discuss the human
factors implications for designing more effective eye-wearable technology,
including display position, issues of monocular display, and how the physical
proximity of the technology affects users' reliance level.

while for longer interactions (up to 10 seconds), the front areas above the

%X With recent progress in display technology, visual see-through head-mounted
displays are beginning to enter our everyday lives. Especially in cars they may
replace head-up displays, as they can theoretically perfectly imitate them but
are more flexible to use. However, prior work has shown that both screen- and
vehicle-stabilized content suffer from drawbacks such as occlusion or
technological limitations. As a potential alternative, we propose three concept
alternatives, in which head rotation is used to manipulate the displayed
content differently from both of the known stabilization techniques. In a
qualitative user study, we identify the best concept proposal and then evaluate
it against the established content stabilization techniques. The presented
concept is perceived to be more applicable for the proposed use case and
effectively reduces some of the known problems of both stabilization
techniques.

(VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) in a survey of 108 VR HMD users. Users
reported significant issues in interacting with, and being aware of their
real-world context when using a HMD. Building upon existing work on blending
real and virtual environments, we performed three design studies to address
these usability concerns. In a typing study, we show that augmenting VR with a
view of reality significantly corrected the performance impairment of typing in
VR. We then investigated how much reality should be incorporated and when, so
as to preserve users' sense of presence in VR. For interaction with objects and
peripherals, we found that selectively presenting reality as users engaged with
it was optimal in terms of performance and users' sense of presence. Finally,
we investigated how this selective, engagement-dependent approach could be
applied in social environments, to support the user's awareness of the
proximity and presence of others.

of tangible interfaces utilizing smartphones' existing audio functionality. By
combining design primitives, familiar physical mechanisms can all be

show that Acoustruments can achieve 99% accuracy with minimal training, is
robust to noise, and can be rapidly prototyped. Acoustruments adds a new method
to the toolbox HCI practitioners and researchers can draw upon, while
introducing a cheap and passive method for adding interactive controls to

%X Using a smartphone for touch input to control apps and games mirrored to a
distant screen is difficult, as the user cannot see where she is touching while
looking at the distant display. We present HaptiCase, an interaction technique
that provides back-of-device tactile landmarks that the user senses with her
fingers to estimate the location of her finger in relation to the touchscreen.
By pinching the thumb resting above the touch-screen to a finger at the back,
the finger position is transferred to the front as the thumb touches the
screen. In a study, we compared touch performance of different landmark layouts
with a regular landmark-free mobile device. Using a landmark design of dots on
a 3x5 grid significantly improves eyes-free tapping accuracy and allows targets
to be as small as 17.5 mm -- a 14% reduction in target size -- to cover 99% of
all touches. When users can look at the touchscreen, landmarks have no
significant effect on performance. HaptiCase is low-cost, requires no
electronics, and works with unmodified software.

conversations. We conducted a user study to observe how seven couples used it

showed the private and natural uses, and integrated uses of tactile and visual
expressions along with the uses of the vocabularies developed through Bendi. In
addition, there were active uses even in negative and serious conversational
context with its pleasant tactile feelings and movement representations.
Lastly, we discuss issues for the future designs and real-world deployment of
shape-changing mobile devices for daily use.

%X Surface and object recognition is of significant importance in ubiquitous
and wearable computing. While various techniques exist to infer context from
material properties and appearance, they are typically neither designed for
real-time applications nor for optically complex surfaces that may be specular,
textureless, and even transparent. These materials are, however, becoming
increasingly relevant in HCI for transparent displays, interactive surfaces,
and ubiquitous computing. We present SpecTrans, a new sensing technology for
surface classification of exotic materials, such as glass, transparent plastic,
and metal. The proposed technique extracts optical features by employing laser
and multi-directional, multi-spectral LED illumination that leverages the
material's optical properties. The sensor hardware is small in size, and the
proposed classification method requires significantly lower computational cost
than conventional image-based methods, which use texture features or
reflectance analysis, thereby providing real-time performance for ubiquitous
computing. Our evaluation of the sensing technique for nine different
transparent materials, including air, shows a promising recognition rate of
99.0%. We demonstrate a variety of possible applications using SpecTrans'
capabilities.

anxiety. Furthermore, compared to drivers facing an unambiguous display of
range, drivers presented with an ambiguous range display reported improved
driving experience, and exhibited driving behavior better adapted to road and

%X Software is playing an increasingly important role in supporting human
decision-making. Previous HCI research on decision support systems (DSS) has
improved the information visualization aspect of DSS information design, but
has somewhat overlooked the cognitive aspect of decision-making, namely that
human reasoning is heuristic and reflects systematic errors or cognitive
biases. We report on an empirical study of two cognitive biases: conservatism
and loss aversion. Two remediation techniques recommended by previous research
were tested: the expected return method, an actuarial-inspired approach
presenting objective metrics; and bootstrapping, a technique successful in
improving judgment consistency. The results show that the two biases can occur
simultaneously and can have a huge impact on decision-making. The results also
show that the two debiasing techniques are only partly effective. These
findings suggest a need for more research on debiasing, and indicate some
directions for exploring debiasing techniques and building decision support
systems.

%X A method for primed product comparisons was developed, based on the
methodological considerations of emotional appraisal process and affective
mental contents. The method was implemented as a computer tool, which was
utilised in two experiments (N = 18 for both). Ten adjectives served as primes,
and five drinking glass pictures as stimuli. Participants' task was to choose a
preference between two glasses, given the priming adjective. The results
validate the method by providing test-retest reliability measures and showing
convergence with questionnaires. Further, different evaluation times between
the primes and the stimuli reveal the existence of different mental processes
associated with various aspects of product experience, as predicted by
appraisal theory. The results have various implications for experience research
and development in HCI, as they demonstrate how the method can be used for
product evaluation and the analysis of the mental processes, which users use to
evaluate the products.

%X Native advertising, ads that are highly cohesive with actual content in
format and style, is a pervasive online trend. We report on a two-stage
Mechanical Turk experiment exploring the effects of perceived quality of native
ads on perceptions of site quality. First, a set of native ads was rated (N=98)
for perceived annoyance and trust. Second, we compare four conditions of an
aggregation of news headlines (N=237): 'no ads', 'low quality ads', 'high
quality ads + content-relevant', 'high-quality ads + not content-relevant'. Our
results indicate that native ads, which in isolation have been rated as high
quality, could still have a negative effect on perceived site credibility and
perceived site quality if they are too content-relevant. In addition to the
effect of ad quality alone (e.g. non-annoying, trustworthy ads), there is an
additional impact for ads that are too similar to content; avoiding confusion
is important for quality perceptions.

%X In this paper the role of game performance as an assessment tool is explored
and an approach is presented for designing and assessing learning-centered game
scores. In recent years, attention has shifted from focusing on games for
learning to games for assessment. The research question this paper tries to
address is how valid games are as an assessment tool, and more specifically,
how valid the use of game scores are as a measure of assessment. To explore
this use, we looked at the role of game performance in a game where the goals
were designed based on its learning objectives. We hypothesized that because of
this design the scores could be used as a measure of learning. The results of
our mixed-methods study confirmed this hypothesis. However, the scores are
influenced by factors such as computer skills and age. Further analysis
revealed that the design of the game and the game-based training were also of
influence. These insights will help in designing better predictive game scores
in the future.

%X Games are normally considered to be "fun", though recently there is growing
interest in how gameplay can promote empathy and encourage reflection through
"serious experience". However, when looking beyond enjoyment, it is not clear
how to actually evaluate serious experience. We present an evaluation of four
games that were submitted to a student game design competition; the competition
challenged teams to design a game that inspired curiosity around human error
and blame culture within the context of healthcare. The entries were judged by
a panel of six experts and subjected to a round of play testing by twelve
participants. Methods included gameplay observation, questionnaires, post-play
interviews and follow-up email questions. We discuss the utility of these
methods, with particular emphasis on how they enabled a consideration of the
immediate and longer term impact of serious experience on players.

%X When player skill levels differ widely in a competitive First-Person Shooter
(FPS) game, enjoyment suffers: weaker players become frustrated and stronger
players become less engaged. Player balancing techniques attempt to assist the
weaker player and make games more competitive, but these techniques have
limitations for deployment when skill levels vary substantially. We developed
new player balancing schemes to deal with a range of FPS skill difference, and
tested these techniques in one-on-one deathmatches using a commercial-quality
FPS game developed with the UDK engine. Our results showed that the new
balancing schemes are extremely effective at balancing, even for players with
large skill differences. Surprisingly, the techniques that were most effective
at balancing were also rated as most enjoyable by both players -- even though
these schemes were the most noticeable. Our study is the first to show that
player balancing can work well in realistic FPS games, providing developers
with a way to increase the audience for this popular genre. In addition, our
results demonstrate the idea that successful balancing is as much about the way
the technique is applied as it is about the specific manipulation.

%X Video games provide unique interactive player experiences (PX) often
categorised into different genres. Prior research has looked at different game
genres, but rarely through a PX lens. Especially, PX in the emerging area of
massive online battle arena (MOBA) games is not well understood by researchers
in the field. We address this knowledge gap by presenting a PX study of
different game genres, which we followed up with a second semi-structured
interview study about PX in MOBA games. Among the results of our analyses are
that games that are likely played with other players, such as MOBA games,
stimulate less immersion and presence for players. Additionally, while
challenge and frustration are significantly higher in this genre, players get a
sense of satisfaction from teamwork, competition and mastery of complex
gameplay interactions. Our study is the first to contribute a comprehensive
insight into key motivators of MOBA players and how PX in this genre is
different from other genres.

%X Non-homeless youths outperform their homeless peers in school even if they
live in extreme poverty. This disadvantage can have long-term consequences for
engagement with and navigation of wider society. In this paper we examine how
differences in achievement could be tackled outside of school through the
re-envisioning of ecologies of digital education. Through interviews, design
workshops, and a street visit with a total of 20 homeless young adults during a
three-week engagement with a centre for people of low social stability in
Bucharest, Romania, we examine the perceptions of education among street
involved youth or adults. We identify the core values, aspirations,
opportunities and barriers for education among these people, including
survival, friendship, learning networks, and curiosity. These findings resulted
in five implications for design: learning "happens", learning "works",
designing for distanced learning, designing for the social politics of
learning, and designing artefacts of everyday learning. These show the
importance and necessity of educational reform in the field of HCI.

%X The digital-sharing economy presents opportunities for individuals to find
temporary employment, generate extra income, increase reciprocity, enhance
social interaction, and access resources not otherwise attainable. Although the
sharing economy is profitable, little is known about its use among the
unemployed or those struggling financially. This paper describes the results of
a participatory-design based workshop to investigate the perception and
feasibility of finding temporary employment and sharing spare resources using
sharing-economy applications. Specifically, this study included 20 individuals
seeking employment in a U.S. city suffering economic decline. We identify
success factors of the digital-sharing economy to these populations, identify
shortcomings and propose mitigation strategies based on prior research related
to trust, social capital and theories of collective efficacy. Finally, we
contribute new principles that may foster collaborative consumption within this
population and identify new concepts for practical employment applications
among these populations.

%X This paper contributes to the current discourse on practice-based research
in HCI paying particular attention to the overall temporal and situational
conditions which frame an R&amp;D project. We present a Living Lab study
situated in an arbitrary neighborhood of a German city which develops ICT
support to foster informal help and social interaction with a special, but not
exclusive, focus on elderly tenants. We demonstrate that practice-based,
long-term research in a city quarter goes beyond those challenges already
described in the current Living Lab and PD literature. The long-term study's
positioning in a real-world context is contoured not only by a high diversity
of stakeholders and their individual interests and motivation for participation
but also by their individual skill sets and learning needs. These distinct and
often contradictive perspectives have to be permanently counterbalanced. Thus
attention has to be focused on how related strategies and decisions impact on
the design of the project as well as on the final ICT product. To enable all
tenants, irrespective of age and technical skill, to participate in a long-term
ICT-based community development project, we applied the format of
'experience-based PD workshops' to foster confidence in ICT usage and encourage
the competency of the elderly and non-tech-savvy tenants.

%X Given the choice, users produce passwords reflecting common strategies and
patterns that ease recall but offer uncertain and often weak security.
System-assigned passwords provide measurable security but suffer from poor
memorability. To address this usability-security tension, we argue that systems
should assign random passwords but also help with memorization and recall. We
investigate the feasibility of this approach with CuedR, a novel
cued-recognition authentication scheme that provides users with multiple cues
(visual, verbal, and spatial) and lets them choose the cues that best fit their
learning process for later recognition of system-assigned keywords. In our lab
study, all 37 of our participants could log in within three attempts one week
after registration (mean login time: 38.0 seconds). A pilot study on using
multiple CuedR passwords also showed 100% recall within three attempts. Based
on our results, we suggest appropriate applications for CuedR, such as
financial and e-commerce accounts.

%X This paper explores the feasibility of automatically extracting passwords
from a user's daily activity logs, such as her Facebook activity, phone
activity etc. As an example, a smartphone might ask the user: "Today morning
from whom did you receive an SMS?" In this paper, we observe that infrequent
activities (i.e., outliers) can be memorable and unpredictable. Building on
this observation, we have developed an end to end system ActivPass and
experimented with 70 users. With activity logs from Facebook, browsing history,
call logs, and SMSs, the system achieves 95% success (authenticates legitimate
users) and is compromised in 5.5% cases (authenticates impostors). While this
level of security is obviously inadequate for serious authentication systems,
certain practices such as password sharing can immediately be thwarted from the
dynamic nature of passwords. With security improvements in the future,
activity-based authentication could fill in for the inadequacies in today's
password-based systems.

%X To prevent abuses of Internet services, CAPTCHAs are used to distinguish
humans from programs where an audio-based scheme is beneficial to support
visually impaired people. Previous studies show that most audio CAPTCHAs,
albeit hard to solve for humans, are lacking security strength. In this work we
propose an audio CAPTCHA that is far more robust against automated attacks than
it is reported for current CAPTCHA schemes. The CAPTCHA exhibits a good
trade-off between human usability and security. This is achieved by exploiting
the fact that the human capabilities of language understanding and speech
recognition are clearly superior compared to current machines. We evaluate the
CAPTCHA security by using a state-of-the-art attack and assess the
intelligibility by means of a large-scale listening experiment.

proposed meter with a real world dataset (i.e., with complete ecological
validity), we created an Android application called EnCloud that allows users
to encrypt their Dropbox files. 101 pattern locks generated by real EnCloud
users were collected and analyzed, where some portion of the users were
provided with the meter support. Our statistical analysis indicates that about
10% of the pattern locks that were generated without the meter support could be
compromised through just 16 guessing attempts. As for the pattern locks that
were generated with the meter support, that number goes up to 48 guessing
attempts, showing significant improvement in security. Our recommendation is to
implement a strength meter in the next version of Android.

%X Blind people often seek answers to their visual questions from remote
sources, however, the commonly adopted single-image, single-response model does
not always guarantee enough bandwidth between users and sources. This is
especially true when questions concern large sets of information, or spatial
layout, e.g., where is there to sit in this area, what tools are on this work
bench, or what do the buttons on this machine do? Our RegionSpeak system
addresses this problem by providing an accessible way for blind users to (i)
combine visual information across multiple photographs via image stitching, em
(ii) quickly collect labels from the crowd for all relevant objects contained
within the resulting large visual area in parallel, and (iii) then
interactively explore the spatial layout of the objects that were labeled. The
regions and descriptions are displayed on an accessible touchscreen interface,
which allow blind users to interactively explore their spatial layout. We
demonstrate that workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk are able to quickly and
accurately identify relevant regions, and that asking them to describe only one
region at a time results in more comprehensive descriptions of complex images.
RegionSpeak can be used to explore the spatial layout of the regions
identified. It also demonstrates broad potential for helping blind users to
answer difficult spatial layout questions.

%X In recent decades, great technological strides have been made toward
enabling people who are blind to live independent, successful lives. However,
there has been relatively little progress towards understanding the social,
collaborative needs of this population, particularly in the domestic setting.
We conducted semi-structured interviews in the homes of 10 pairs of close
companions in which one partner was blind and one was not. We found that
partners engaged in collaborative accessibility by taking active roles in
co-creating an accessible environment. Due to their different visual abilities,
however, partners sometimes encountered difficulties managing divergent needs
and engaging in shared experiences. We describe outstanding challenges to
creating accessible shared home spaces and outline new research and technology
opportunities for supporting collaborative accessibility in the home.

whiteboard that gives participants a 3D immersive experience, enabled only by
an RGBD camera (Microsoft Kinect) mounted on the side of a large touch display.
Using 3D processing of the depth images, life-sized rendering, and novel
visualizations, ImmerseBoard emulates writing side-by-side on a physical
whiteboard, or alternatively on a mirror. User studies involving three tasks
show that compared to standard video conferencing with a digital whiteboard,
ImmerseBoard provides participants with a quantitatively better ability to
estimate their remote partners' eye gaze direction, gesture direction,
intention, and level of agreement. Moreover, these quantitative capabilities
translate qualitatively into a heightened sense of being together and a more

user can accurately determine the target, that eye gaze alone is more accurate
than combined with the hand, and that the relative position between the viewer
and the video feed has little effect on accuracy. These findings can inform the
design of future telepresence systems for wall-sized displays.

%X Robotic telepresence systems-videoconferencing systems that allow a remote
user to drive around in another location-are an emerging technology for
supporting geographically-distributed teams. Thus far, many of these systems
rely on affordances designed for stationary systems, such as a single,
narrow-view camera to provide vision for the remote user. Teleoperation has
offered some solutions to this via an augmented field-of-view, but how these
solutions support task outcomes in collaborative mobile telepresence tasks has
yet to be understood. To investigate this, we conducted a three condition
(field-of-view: narrow (45&deg;) vs. wide-angle (180&deg;) vs. panoramic
(360&deg;)) between-participants controlled laboratory experiment. We asked
participants (N=24) to collaborate with a confederate via a robotic
telepresence system while using one of these views in a redecoration task. Our
results showed that wider views supported task efficiency and fewer collisions,
but were perceived as more difficult to use.

%X A long-term goal of game design research is to achieve end-to-end automation
of much of the design process, one aspect of which is creating effective level
progressions. A key difficulty is getting the player to practice with
interesting combinations of learned skills while maintaining their engagement.
Although recent work in task generation and sequencing has reduced this effort,
we still lack end-to-end automation of the entire content design process. We
approach this goal by incorporating ideas from intelligent tutoring systems and
proposing progression strategies that seek to achieve mastery of not only base
concepts but arbitrary combinations of these concepts. The input to our system
is a model of what the player needs to do to complete each level, expressed as
either an imperative procedure for producing solutions or a representation of
features common to all solutions. The output is a progression of levels that
can be adjusted by changing high-level parameters. We apply our framework to a
popular math puzzle game and present results from 2,377 players showing that
our automatic level progression is comparable to expert-crafted progression
after a few design iterations based on a key engagement metric.

%X We have developed a mobile application called Pass The Ball that enables
users to track, reflect on, and discuss physical activity with others. We
followed an iterative design process, trialling a first version of the app with
20 people and a second version with 31. The trials were conducted in the wild,
on users' own devices. The second version of the app enforced a turn-taking
system that meant only one member of a group of users could track their
activity at any one time. This constrained tracking at the individual level,
but more successfully led users to communicate and interact with each other. We
discuss the second trial with reference to two concepts: social-relatedness and
individual-competence. We discuss six key lessons from the trial, and identify
two high-level design implications: attend to "practices" of tracking; and look
within and beyond "collaboration" and "competition" in the design of activity
trackers.

order to shed light onto the complex lives of physical things and the ways in
which they acquire data footprints. We take an extended view of the practice,
revealing how people invest great effort into crafting miniatures, playing with
them, curating and telling stories about them, and passing them on. Throughout,
we emphasise the use of both traditional and digital technologies to build rich
data footprints. In discussing our findings, we adopt a "thing-centric"
perspective that focuses on the extended lifetimes of the miniatures
themselves. This enables us to identify opportunities for digital augmentation
in support of capturing "life away from the table" and a need for HCI to focus
on designing trajectories of things.

%X A growing number of HCI scholars have started to take materiality as an
entry point for acquiring a deeper understanding of the possibilities and
constraints of design. Steadily moving beyond a distinction between the
physical and the digital, a few have also started to look at materials as part
of the unfolding of social and cultural practices. Yet, to date, relatively
little is known about how these practices develop within the situated
experience of materials, and how this situational whole can be supported by
design. By contributing to both growing materiality scholarship and emerging
practice-oriented approaches in HCI, this paper articulates a framework of
materials experience that discusses how materials shape ways of doing and
ultimately, practice, and how this is rooted in the experience of those
materials.

smooth integration with paper, for an overall of 20 different interactive
components. We also contribute a logic demonstration and recording approach,
Pulsation, that allows for specifying functional relationships between widgets.
Using the final design and the recorded Pulsation logic, PaperPulse generates
layered electronic circuit designs, and code that can be deployed on a

situates it in participatory data translation activities to demonstrate that
this technology can find application beyond its use as tool for manufacture. We
present two contrasting design contexts in which, respectively, data from
conference twitter conversations and craft practitioners' movements are
translated into interactively generated and fabricated physical artefacts. We
argue that direct involvement in such digital fabrication activities can help
people invest meaning into artefacts and facilitate social interaction and
reflection upon their activities, while encouraging practitioners to
incorporate new forms into their own work. On this basis, we reconsider digital
fabrication within data translation activities as situated along an extended
'trajectory of use' in which reflective, meaningful 'data-things' can be
created.

people to (re)consider materials found in their everyday and personal

involving hybrid (physical-digital) fabrication by describing how our system
draws from art to support critical and reflective modes of making. In
interaction with our system, participants distributed control between human and
machine actors to support their preferred mode of making. These patterns reveal
new opportunities and challenges for future hybrid fabrication systems, and
suggest that designing for qualities of experience, like meditation and
reflection, could support meaningful making experiences for many different
kinds of makers.

spatiotemporal vibrotactile patterns. However, recognition of the same patterns
on other body parts is unknown. In this paper, we investigate how users
perceive spatiotemporal vibrotactile patterns on the arm, palm, thigh, and
waist. Results of the first two experiments indicate that precise recognition
of either position or orientation is difficult across multiple body parts.
Nonetheless, users were able to distinguish whether two vibration pulses were
from the same location when played in quick succession. Based on this finding,
we designed eight spatiotemporal vibrotactile patterns and evaluated them in
two additional experiments. The results demonstrate that these patterns can be
reliably recognized (&gt;80%) across the four tested body parts, both in the
lab and in a more realistic context.

noticeability of four instantaneous notification channels (light, vibration,
sound, poke) and a channel with gradually increased temperature (thermal)
during five levels of physical activity (laying down, sitting, standing,
walking, and running). Results showed that vibration was the most reliable and
fastest channel to convey notification, followed by poke and sound which shared
similar noticeability. The noticeability of these three channels was not
affected by the level of physical activity. The other two channels, light and
thermal, were less noticeable and were affected by the level of physical
activity. Our post-experimental survey indicates that while noticeability has a
significant influence on user preference, each channel has its own unique
advantages that make it suitable for different notification scenarios.

%X We propose a new type of tactile displays that drag a physical tactor across
the skin in 2D. We call this skin drag. We demonstrate how this allows us to
communicate geometric shapes or characters to users. The main benefit of our
approach is that it simultaneously produces two types of stimuli, i.e., (1) it
moves a tactile stimulus across skin locations and (2) it stretches the user's
skin. Skin drag thereby combines the essential stimuli produced by vibrotactile
and skin stretch. In our study, skin drag allowed participants to recognize
tactile shapes significantly better than a vibrotactile array of comparable
size. We present two arm-worn prototype devices that implement our concept.

%X Pedestrian navigation systems require users to perceive, interpret, and
react to navigation information. This can tax cognition as navigation
information competes with information from the real world. We propose actuated
navigation, a new kind of pedestrian navigation in which the user does not need
to attend to the navigation task at all. An actuation signal is directly sent
to the human motor system to influence walking direction. To achieve this goal
we stimulate the sartorius muscle using electrical muscle stimulation. The
rotation occurs during the swing phase of the leg and can easily be
counteracted. The user therefore stays in control. We discuss the properties of
actuated navigation and present a lab study on identifying basic parameters of
the technique as well as an outdoor study in a park. The results show that our
approach changes a user's walking direction by about 16&deg;/m on average and
that the system can successfully steer users in a park with crowded areas,
distractions, obstacles, and uneven ground.

%X We propose extending the affordance of objects by allowing them to
communicate dynamic use, such as (1) motion (e.g., spray can shakes when
touched), (2) multi-step processes (e.g., spray can sprays only after shaking),
and (3) behaviors that change over time (e.g., empty spray can does not allow
spraying anymore). Rather than enhancing objects directly, however, we
implement this concept by enhancing the user. We call this affordance++. By
stimulating the user's arms using electrical muscle stimulation, our prototype
allows objects not only to make the user actuate them, but also perform
required movements while merely approaching the object, such as not to touch
objects that do not "want" to be touched. In our user study, affordance++
helped participants to successfully operate devices of poor natural affordance,
such as a multi-functional slicer tool or a magnetic nail sweeper, and to stay
away from cups filled with hot liquids.

%X Conflicts between the pilot and the automation, when pilots detect but do
not understand them, cause "automation surprise" situations and jeopardize
flight safety. We conducted an experiment in a 3-axis motion flight simulator
with 16 pilots equipped with an eye-tracker to analyze their behavior and eye
movements during the occurrence of such a situation. The results revealed that
this conflict engages participant's attentional abilities resulting in
excessive and inefficient visual search patterns. This experiment confirmed the
crucial need to design solutions for detecting the occurrence of conflictual
situations and to assist the pilots. We therefore proposed an approach to
formally identify the occurrence of "automation surprise" conflicts based on
the analysis of "silent mode changes" of the autopilot. A demonstrator was
implemented and allowed for the automatic trigger of messages in the cockpit
that explains the autopilot behavior. We implemented a real-time demonstrator
that was tested as a proof-of-concept with 7 subjects facing 3 different
conflicts with automation. The results shown the efficacy of this approach
which could be implemented in existing cockpits.

implemented and relied upon by users. Past research has focused on factors
associated with the user and automation technology to explain reliance. The
purpose of the present study was determining how the predictability of the
environment affects reliance. In this paper, we present the results from an
experiment using a digital game where participants had access to a free
environmental cue of varying predictive validity. Some participants also had
access to automated advice at varying costs. We found that participants
underutilized automated advice in more predictable environments and when advice
was more costly; however, when costs were low and the environment was less
predictable, participants tended to overutilize automated advice. These
findings provide insights for a more complete model of automation use, and
offer a framework for understanding automation biases by considering how
automation use compares to a model of optimality.

%X Increasingly natural, sensed, and touch-based input is being integrated into
devices. Along the way, both custom and more general solutions have been
developed for dealing with the uncertainty that is associated with these forms
of input. However, it is difficult to provide dynamic, flexible, and continuous
feedback about uncertainty using traditional interactive infrastructure. Our
contribution is a general architecture with the goal of providing support for
continual feedback about uncertainty. Our architecture is based on prior work
in modeling uncertainty using Monte Carlo sampling, and tracks multiple
interfaces -- one for each plausible and differentiable sequence of input that
the user may have intended. Importantly, it considers how the presentation of
uncertainty can be organized and implemented in a general way. Our primary
contribution is a method for reducing the number of alternative interfaces and
fusing possible interfaces into a single interface that both communicates
uncertainty and allows for disambiguation. We demonstrate the value of this
result through a collection of 11 new and existing feedback techniques along
with two applications demonstrating the use of the feedback architecture.

%X In order to enable unobtrusive human object interaction detection, we
propose a minimalistic approach to instrumenting everyday objects with passive
(i.e. battery-free) UHF RFID tags. By measuring the changes in the physical
layer of the communication channel between the RFID tag and reader (such as
RSSI, RF phase, and read rate) we are able to classify, in real time,
tag/object motion events along with two types of touch events. Through a user
study, we demonstrate that our real-time classification engine is able to
simultaneously track 20 objects and identify four movement classes with 93%
accuracy. To demonstrate how robust this general-purpose interaction mechanism
is, we investigate three usage scenarios 1) interactive storytelling with toys
2) inference of daily activities in the home 3) identification of customer
browsing habits in a retail setting.

on camera versus what happens 'backstage'; and balancing being a player of the
game with being a performer. By reflecting on how they achieve this, we are

%X We developed Trap it!, a human-biology interaction (HBI) medium encompassing
a touchscreen interface, microscopy, and light projection. Users can interact
with living cells by drawing on a touchscreen displaying the microscope view of
the cells. These drawings are projected onto the microscopy field as light
patterns, prompting observable movement in phototactic responses. The system
design enables stable and robust HBI and a wide variety of programmed
activities (art, games, and experiments). We investigated its affordances as an
exhibit in a science museum in both facilitated and unfacilitated contexts.
Overall, it had a low barrier of entry and fostered rich communication among
visitors. Visitors were particularly excited upon realizing that the
interaction involved real organisms, an understanding that was facilitated by
the eyepiece on the physical system. With the results from user study, we
provide our observations, insights and guidelines for designing HBI as a
permanent museum exhibit.

%X Social media has emerged as a prominent platform where people can express
their feelings about social and political issues of our time. We study the many
voices discussing an issue within a constituency and how they reflect ideology
and may signal the outcome of important policy decisions. Focusing on the issue
of same-sex marriage legalization, we examine almost 2 million public Twitter
posts related to same-sex marriage in the U.S. states over the course of 4
years starting from 2011. Among other findings, we find evidence of moral
culture wars between ideologies and show that constituencies that express
higher levels of emotion and have fewer actively engaged participants often
precede legalization efforts that fail. From our measures, we build statistical
models to predict the outcome of potential policy changes, with our best model
achieving 87% accuracy. We also achieve accuracies of 70%, comparable to public
opinion surveys, many months before a policy decision. We discuss how these
analyses can augment traditional political science techniques as well as assist
activists and policy analysts in understanding discussions on important issues
at a population scale.

%X People have long sought answers to questions online, typically using either
anonymous or pseudonymous forums or social network platforms that primarily use
real names. Systems that allow anonymous communication afford freedom to
explore identity and discuss taboo topics, but can result in negative
disinhibited behavior such as cyberbullying. Identifiable communication systems
allows one to reach a known audience and avoid negative disinhibition, but can
constrain behavior with concerns about privacy and reputation. One persistent
design issue is understanding how to leverage the benefits of anonymity without
suffering its drawbacks. This paper presents a case study analysis of question
asking on Facebook confession boards (FCBs), a tool popular on some college
campuses. FCBs present a unique configuration in which members of an offline
community (e.g., a university) anonymously submit content to a moderator who
posts it to a Facebook page where others in the community can view it and
respond. Response is via identifiable Facebook comments and likes. Our results
show users asking about taboo and stigmatized topics with local others, and
receiving relevant responses with little cyberbullying or negativity.

%X Sporting championships and other media events can induce very strong
feelings of co-presence that can change communication patterns within large
communities. Live tweeting reactions to media events provide high-resolution
data with time-stamps to understand these behavioral dynamics. We employ a
computational focus group method to identify a population of 790,744
international Twitter users, and we track their behavior before, during, and
after the 2014 FIFA World Cup. We pick, in particular, a set of Twitter users
who specified the teams that they are supporting, such that we can identify
communities of fans of the teams, as well as the entire community of World Cup
fans. The structure, dynamics, and content of communication of these
communities of users are analyzed to compare behavior outside of the matches to
behavior during the event and to examine behavioral responses across languages.
Specifically, the temporal patterns of the tweeting volume, topics, retweeting,
and mentioning behaviors are analyzed. We find there are similarities in the
responses to media events, characteristic changes in activity patterns of
users, and substantial differences in linguistic features. These findings have
implications for designing more resilient socio-technical systems during crises
and developing better models of complex social behavior.

%X How are you related to Malawi? Do recent events on the Comoros effect you in
any subtle way? Who in your extended social network is in Croatia? We seldom
ask ourselves these questions, yet a "long tail" of content beyond our everyday
knowledge is waiting to be explored. In this work we propose a recommendation
task of creating interest in little-known content by building personalized
"bridges" to users. We consider an example task of interesting users in
little-known countries, and propose a system which aggregates a user's Twitter
profile, network, and tweets to create an interest model, which is then matched
to a library of knowledge about the countries. We perform a user study of 69
participants and conduct 11 in-depth interviews in order to evaluate the
efficacy of the proposed approach and gather qualitative insight into the
effect of multi-faceted use of Twitter on the perception of the bridges. We
find the increase in interest concerning little-known content to greatly depend
on the pre-existing disposition to it. Additionally, we discover a set of vital
properties good bridges must possess, including recency, novelty, emotiveness,
and a proper selection of language. Using the proposed approach we aim to
harvest the "invisible connections" to make explicit the idea of a "small
world" where even a faraway country is more closely connected to you than you
might have imagined.

%X Preventable behaviors contribute to many life threatening health problems.
Behavior-change technologies have been deployed to modify these, but such
systems typically draw on traditional behavioral theories that overlook affect.
We examine the importance of emotion tracking for behavior change. First, we
conducted interviews to explore how emotions influence unwanted behaviors.
Next, we deployed a system intervention, in which 35 participants logged
information for a self-selected, unwanted behavior (e.g., smoking or
overeating) over 21 days. 16 participants engaged in standard behavior tracking
using a Fact-Focused system to record objective information about goals. 19
participants used an Emotion-Focused system to record emotional consequences of
behaviors. Emotion-Focused logging promoted more successful behavior change and
analysis of logfiles revealed mechanisms for success: greater engagement of
negative affect for unsuccessful days and increased insight were key to
motivating change. We present design implications to improve behavior-change
technologies with emotion tracking.

%X Habit formation is an important part of behavior change interventions: to
ensure an intervention has long-term effects, the new behavior has to turn into
a habit and become automatic. Smartphone apps could help with this process by
supporting habit formation. To better understand how, we conducted a 4-week
study exploring the influence of different types of cues and positive
reinforcement on habit formation and reviewed the functionality of 115 habit
formation apps. We discovered that relying on reminders supported repetition
but hindered habit development, while the use of event-based cues led to
increased automaticity; positive reinforcement was ineffective. The
functionality review revealed that existing apps focus on self-tracking and
reminders, and do not support event-based cues. We argue that apps, and
technology-based interventions in general, have the potential to provide real
habit support, and present design guidelines for interventions that could
support habit formation through contextual cues and implementation intentions.

lives. This paper draws on critical practice and speculative design to explore,
question and problematise the ultimate consequences of such technology using
the quantification of companion animals (pets) as a case study. We apply the
concept of "moving upstream" to study such technology and use a qualitative
research approach in which both pet owners, and animal behavioural experts,
were presented with, and asked to discuss, speculative designs for pet
quantification applications, the design of which were extrapolated from
contemporary trends. Our findings indicate a strong desire among pet owners for
technology that has little scientific justification, whilst our experts caution
that the use of technology to augment human-animal communication has the
potential to disimprove animal welfare, undermine human-animal bonds, and
create human-human conflicts. Our discussion informs wider debates regarding
quantification technology.

canine behavioral specialists, together with their cancer detection dogs,
teamed up to better support the dogs' life-saving work. We discuss interspecies
communication challenges in cancer detection training, requiring the dogs to
use human signaling conventions that perturb their detection work. We describe
our effort to develop a technology that could resolve those challenges, and how
in the process our design focus gradually shifted from a human-centered to a
canine-centered interaction model. The resulting interface, based on honest
signaling, re-centers cancer detection practices on the dogs themselves,
enabling them to better express their potential as cancer detection workers; it
also provides a model for re-thinking human-computer interactions.

%X Many different domains collect event sequence data and rely on finding and
analyzing patterns within it to gain meaningful insights. Current systems that
support such queries either provide limited expressiveness, hinder exploratory
workflows or present interaction and visualization models which do not scale
well to large and multi-faceted data sets. In this paper we present (s|qu)eries
(pronounced "Squeries"), a visual query interface for creating queries on
sequences (series) of data, based on regular expressions. (s|qu)eries is a
touch-based system that exposes the full expressive power of regular
expressions in an approachable way and interleaves query specification with
result visualizations. Being able to visually investigate the results of
different query-parts supports debugging and encourages iterative
query-building as well as exploratory work-flows. We validate our design and
implementation through a set of informal interviews with data scientists that
analyze event sequences on a daily basis.

novice analysts, this is cognitively demanding and can lead to mistakes and
misinterpretations of the results. We present Statsplorer, a software that
helps novices learn and perform inferential statistical tests. It lets the user
kick-start data analysis from their research questions. Statsplorer
automatically tests necessary statistical assumptions and uses visualizations
to guide the user in both selecting statistical tests and interpreting the
results. We compared Statsplorer with a statistics lecture and investigated how
Statsplorer prepares novices for learning statistics in an AB/BA crossover
experiment. The results indicates that using Statsplorer prior to the lecture
leads to significantly better test scores in understanding statistical
assumptions and choosing appropriate statistical tests. Statsplorer is

control the pace at which data are updated. We explore the design and usability
of this technique for table variations in size, time spans and data
variability. We report the results of a usability study, using academic
citation rankings and economic complexity datasets, and discuss design
implications coming with real-world scenarios such as missing data and

%X Scatterplots are an effective and commonly used technique to show the
relationship between two variables. However, as the number of data points
increases, the chart suffers from "over-plotting" which obscures data points
and makes the underlying distribution of the data difficult to discern.
Reducing the opacity of the data points is an effective way to address
over-plotting, however, setting the individual point opacity is a manual task
performed by the chart designer. We present a user-driven model of opacity
scaling for scatter plots built from crowd-sourced responses to opacity scaling
tasks using several synthetic data distributions, and then test our model on a
collection of real-world data sets.

data analysis tasks. While there is an established need for reviewing analytic
processes, and many visual history tools provide visualizations to do so, it is
not well known how helpful the tools actually are for process recall. Through a
controlled experiment, we evaluated how the presence of a visual history aid
and varying levels of visual detail affect process memory. Participants
conducted an analysis task using a visual text-document analysis tool. We
evaluated their memories of the process both immediately after the analysis and
then again one week later. Results showed that even visual history views with
reduced data-resolution were effective for aiding process memory. Further, even
without inclusion of any data in the visual history aids, the visual cues alone
from the final workspace were enough to improve memory of the main themes of
analyses.

transition from mobile search engines to mobile apps and vice versa. However,
little is known about the nature of these transitions nor how mobile search and
mobile apps interact. We report on a 2-week, mixed-method study involving 18
Android users, where we collected real-world mobile search and mobile app usage
data alongside subjective insights on why certain interactions between apps and
mobile search occur. Our results show that when people engage with mobile
search they tend to interact with more mobile apps and for longer durations. We
found that certain categories of apps are used more intensely alongside mobile
search. Furthermore we found differences in app usage before and after mobile
search and show how mobile app interactions can both prompt mobile search and
enable users to take action. We conclude with a discussion on what these
patterns mean for mobile search and how we might design mobile search
experiences that take these app interactions into account.

short list of people that one calls and texts to a many-hundred person list of
aggregated contacts from around the web. This is happening at a time when an
increasing number of mobile applications are relying on the mobile phonebook to
create one's social network in their services. Through a large-scale study of
the phonebooks of 200 diverse participants, containing 65,940 contacts, we set
out to understand today's mobile contact lists. Our participants reported that
they did not recognize the names of 29% of their contacts and we found that the
most frequently contacted five contacts represent greater than 80% of all calls
and text messages with phonebook contacts. We conclude with implications for
the design of mobile applications that rely on phonebook data.

settings, providing data scientists with visual interfaces for the analysis of
large datasets. Numerous studies have demonstrated unique perceptual and
cognitive benefits afforded by these displays in visual analytics and
information visualization tasks. However, the effects of these displays on
knowledge discovery in exploratory visual analysis are still poorly understood.
We present the results of a small-scale study to better understand how display
size and resolution affect insight. Analyzing participants' verbal statements,
we find preliminary evidence that larger displays with more pixels can
significantly increase the number of discoveries reported during visual
exploration, while yielding broader, more integrative insights. Furthermore, we
find important differences in how participants performed the same visual
exploration task using displays of varying sizes. We tie these results to
extant work and propose explanations by considering the cognitive and
interaction costs associated with visual exploration.

%X Pixel densities are increasing rapidly. We can observe this trend in
particular for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. Previous work
revealed an effect of pixel density on subjective feedback and objective
performance only for low resolution cathode ray tube screens. It is unclear if
this effect persists for the four times higher pixel densities of current
mobile devices. Therefore, we conducted a study to compare four pixel densities
with 359, 180, 120, and 90 pixels per inch. While participants performed three
tasks involving images, text and videos on a tablet, we measured perceived
effort, perceived visual quality, task completion time, error rate, and body
pose. Our results show that the effect of the pixel density highly depends on
the content. We found that only for text, the four pixel densities have clearly
different perceived media qualities. Pixel density seems to have a smaller
effect on perceived media quality for images and videos and we found no effect
on objective measures. Results show that text should be displayed in high
resolution, while this is less important for images and videos.

%X Edge-scrolling allows users to scroll a viewport while simultaneously
dragging near or beyond a window's edge. Common implementations rely on rate
control, mapping the distance between the pointer and the edge of the viewport
to the scrolling velocity. While ubiquitous in operating systems,
edge-scrolling has received little attention, even though previous works
suggest that (1) rate control may be suboptimal for isotonic pointing devices
like mice and trackpads and (2) space beyond the window's edge might be scarce,
limiting scrolling control. To address these problems, we developed Push-edge
scrolling (and Slide-edge scrolling, its inertial variant), two novel
position-based techniques that allow scrolling by "pushing" against the
viewport edge. A controlled experiment shows that our techniques reduce
overshoots and offer performance improvements by up to 13% over traditional
edge-scrolling.

%X Target expansion techniques facilitate the pointing task by enlarging the
effective sizes of targets. When the target expansion is applied to both the
motor and visual spaces, the visual feedforward mechanism is key: Indeed it
provides a visual aid to the user on the effective expanded targets prior to
the execution or completion of the pointing task, enabling the user to take
full advantage of the target expansion technique. Focusing on feedforward
mechanisms, we introduce a design space that allows us to describe, classify
and design target expansion techniques. To do so we first introduce and
characterize the concept of atomic feedforward mechanism along three design
axes. We then describe a target expansion technique as a combination of atomic
feedforward mechanisms using a matrix-based notation. We provide an analytical
exploration of the design space by classifying existing techniques and by
designing six new techniques. We also provide a first experimental exploration
of the design space in the context of distant pointing. The experimental
protocol includes an innovative target layout for handling non-centroidal
target expansion. The results show that feedforward dynamicity increases
movement time and decreases subjective usability, while explicit expansion
observability efficiently supports error prevention for distant pointing.

%X Many graphic applications rely on command-based arrangement tools to achieve
precise layouts. Traditional tools are designed to operate on a single group of
elements that are distributed consistently with the arrangement axis implied by
a command. This often demands a process with repeated element selections and
arrangement commands to achieve 2D layouts involving multiple rows and/or
columns of well aligned and/or distributed elements. Our work aims to reduce
the numbers of selection operation and command invocation, since such
reductions are particularly beneficial to professional designers who design
lots of layouts. Our key idea is that an issued arrangement command is in fact
very informative, instructing how to automatically decompose a 2D layout into
multiple 1D groups, each of which is compatible with the command. We present a
parameter-free, command-driven grouping approach so that users can easily
predict our grouping results. We also design a simple user interface with
pushpins to enable explicit control of grouping and arrangement. Our user study
confirms the intuitiveness of our technique and its performance improvement
over traditional command-based arrangement tools.

%X Social and emotional skills are crucial for all aspects of our everyday
life. However, understanding how digital technology can facilitate the
development and learning of such skills is yet an under-researched area in HCI.
To start addressing this gap, this paper reports on a series of interviews and
design workshops with the leading researchers and developers of 'Social and
Emotional Learning' (SEL) curricula. SEL is a subfield of educational
psychology with a long history of teaching such skills, and a range of evidence
based curricula that are widely deployed in primary and secondary schools. We
identify the shared challenges across existing curricula that digital
technology might help address: the support for out-of-session learning,
scaffolding for parental engagement, and feedback for the curricula developers.
We argue how this presents an opportunity for mutually beneficial
collaborations, with the potential for significant real-world impact of novel
HCI systems, and can inform HCI work on supporting social and emotional skills
development in other domains.

bridge the gap between fields and maximize the impact of their research,
including instructions on how to identify and describe research participants
and how to avoid research confounds and challenges specific to this population.
We also advocate that researchers in ASD maintain a nimble, adaptable approach

%X Theories of empowerment explain how people gain personal and political
control to take action to improve their lives. However, empowerment theories
were developed prior to the Internet and fail to account for the speed and
scale that people can find one another online. One domain where empowerment is
critical is caring for children with special needs, in which parents are
required to navigate a complex maze of services and processes to access care
for their child. We conducted 43 interviews with parents of children with
special needs to investigate whether using social media sites helps them to
perform this caregiving work. Critically, parents are able to do this through
almost real-time access to other parents on Facebook. This work introduces the
concept of networked empowerment, that describes how parents find other
parents, access resources, and explore new ways for promoting health advocacy
among caregivers at a local and national level. We conclude with design
implications for facilitating faster and better access to information and
support for caregivers.

%X Many children's books contain movable pictures with elements that can be
physically opened, closed, pushed, pulled, spun, flipped, or swung. But these
tangible, interactive reading experiences are inaccessible to children with
visual impairments. This paper presents a set of 3D-printable models designed
as building blocks for creating movable tactile pictures that can be touched,
moved, and understood by children with visual impairments. Examples of these
models are canvases, connectors, hinges, spinners, sliders, lifts, walls, and
cutouts. They can be used to compose movable tactile pictures to convey a range
of spatial concepts, such as in/out, up/down, and high/low. The design and
development of these models were informed by three formative studies including
1) a survey on popular moving mechanisms in children's books and 3D-printed
parts to implement them, 2) two workshops on the process creating movable
tactile pictures by hand (e.g., Lego, Play-Doh), and 3) creation of wood-based
prototypes and an informal testing on sighted preschoolers. Also, we propose a
design language based on XML and CSS for specifying the content and structure
of a movable tactile picture. Given a specification, our system can generate a
3D-printable model. We evaluate our approach by 1) transcribing six children's
books, and 2) conducting six interviews on domain experts including four
teachers for the visually impaired, one blind adult, two publishers at the
National Braille Press, a renowned tactile artist, and a librarian.

manufacturer's communication and game reviews) and in individual use (the way
players and their parents talk about the game). Through an analysis of public
texts and individual use, we show how the balance between the fun and the
serious in Monkey Tales is constructed in different ways.

empowering citizens rather than adopting an informed, inclusive approach that
addresses the needs of both citizens and civic authorities, and helps establish

extensive study of civic engagement in the domain of public infrastructure
maintenance and provide insights into the civic management processes to support
future design of trusted civic engagement interactions.

various programs and stakeholders that compete for limited resources, the
extensiveness and complexity of the budget and its process hinder taxpayers
from understanding the budget information and participating in the public

issues, we leverage news articles containing budgetary information for design
opportunities. We present Factful, a web-based annotative article reading

participants using Factful discussed more critically with more fact-based

with place, both in terms of physical and social geography. We detail three
strands of the project. First, we consider how residents have sought to curate
existing data about the street in the form of an archive with physical and
digital components. Second, we report endeavours to capture data about the
street's environment, especially of vehicle traffic. Third, we draw on the
possibilities afforded by technologies for polling opinion. We reflect on how
these engagements have: materialised distinctive relations between the
community and their data; surfaced flows and contours of data, and spatial,
temporal and social boundaries; and enacted a multiplicity of 'small worlds'.
We consider how such a conceptualisation of data-in-place is relevant to the
design of technology.

security behaviors. We present the creation of such a tool. We surveyed the
most common computer security advice that experts offer to end-users in order
to construct a set of Likert scale questions to probe the extent to which
respondents claim to follow this advice. Using these questions, we iteratively
surveyed a pool of 3,619 computer users to refine our question set such that
each question was applicable to a large percentage of the population, exhibited
adequate variance between respondents, and had high reliability (i.e.,
desirable psychometric properties). After performing both exploratory and
confirmatory factor analysis, we identified a 16-item scale consisting of four
sub-scales that measures attitudes towards choosing passwords, device
securement, staying up-to-date, and proactive awareness.

%X Research on security warnings consistently points to habituation as a key
reason why users ignore security warnings. However, because habituation as a
mental state is difficult to observe, previous research has examined
habituation indirectly by observing its influence on security behaviors. This
study addresses this gap by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
to open the "black box" of the brain to observe habituation as it develops in
response to security warnings. Our results show a dramatic drop in the visual
processing centers of the brain after only the second exposure to a warning,
with further decreases with subsequent exposures. To combat the problem of
habituation, we designed a polymorphic warning that changes its appearance. We
show in two separate experiments using fMRI and mouse cursor tracking that our
polymorphic warning is substantially more resistant to habituation than
conventional warnings. Together, our neurophysiological findings illustrate the
considerable influence of human biology on users' habituation to security
warnings.

%X Browsers warn users when the privacy of an SSL/TLS connection might be at
risk. An ideal SSL warning would empower users to make informed decisions and,
failing that, guide confused users to safety. Unfortunately, users struggle to
understand and often disregard real SSL warnings. We report on the task of
designing a new SSL warning, with the goal of improving comprehension and
adherence. We designed a new SSL warning based on recommendations from warning
literature and tested our proposal with microsurveys and a field experiment. We
ultimately failed at our goal of a well-understood warning. However, nearly 30%
more total users chose to remain safe after seeing our warning. We attribute
this success to opinionated design, which promotes safety with visual cues.
Subsequently, our proposal was released as the new Google Chrome SSL warning.
We raise questions about warning comprehension advice and recommend that other
warning designers use opinionated design.

%X Users often struggle to create passwords under strict requirements. To make
this process easier, some providers present real-time feedback during password
creation, indicating which requirements are not yet met. Other providers guide
users through a multi-step password-creation process. Our 6,435-participant
online study examines how feedback and guidance affect password security and
usability. We find that real-time password-creation feedback can help users
create strong passwords with fewer errors. We also find that although guiding
participants through a three-step password-creation process can make creation
easier, it may result in weaker passwords. Our results suggest that service
providers should present password requirements with feedback to increase
usability. However, the presentation of feedback and guidance must be carefully
considered, since identical requirements can have different security and
usability effects depending on presentation.

aspects of doing sports and the notion of feeling was repeatedly used to talk
about their activities. Technology played both an instrumental role in
measuring performance and feeding bio-data back to them, and an experiential
role in supporting and enhancing the sport experience. To guide further
interaction design research in the sports domain, we suggest two interrelated
ways of looking at sports performances and experiences, firstly through the
notion of a measured sense of performance, and secondly as a lived-sense of
performance.

%X The use of wearable technology will become significantly more prevalent in
the coming years, with major companies releasing devices such as the Samsung
Gear Fit. With sensors, such as pedometers and heart rate monitors, embedded in
these devices it is possible to use them for fitness purposes. However, little
is known about how wearable adopters actually use wearable and existing
technologies during exercise. In an exploratory situated study of technology
use and non-use in the context of the gym, fitness informatics adopters showed
varied practices related to distraction, appropriating technology into their
routines, and information needs. We discuss this variance in relation to
individual differences and the impact of the physical nature of the gym.
Although further research might show other influencing factors such as the
social context, we make a case for the use of situated studies to uncover
tensions that lead to use and non-use of technology that arise in the different
unfolding situations of using wearables in everyday life, including at the gym,
which is a surprisingly complex context.

the understanding of physical activity through abstract visualization also
provide an appetizing drink to celebrate the experience of being physically

opportunities for reflection on one's physical activities. We present
TastyBeats, a fountain-based interactive system that creates a fluidic
spectacle of mixing sport drinks based on heart rate data of physical activity,
which the user can later consume to replenish the loss of body fluids due to
the physical activity. We articulate our experiences in designing the system as
well as learning gained through field deployments of the system in
participants' homes for a period of two weeks. We found that our system
increased participants' awareness of physical activity and facilitated a shared
social experience, while the prepared drink was treated as a hedonic reward
that motivated participants to exercise more. Ultimately, with this work, we
aim to inspire and guide design thinking on palatable representations, which we
believe opens up new interaction possibilities to support physical activity
experience.

%X An ever more sedentary lifestyle is a serious problem in our society.
Enhancing people's exercise adherence through technology remains an important
research challenge. We propose a novel approach for a system supporting walking
that draws from basic findings in neuroscience research. Our shoe-based
prototype senses a person's footsteps and alters in real-time the frequency
spectra of the sound they produce while walking. The resulting sounds are
consistent with those produced by either a lighter or heavier body. Our user
study showed that modified walking sounds change one's own perceived body
weight and lead to a related gait pattern. In particular, augmenting the high
frequencies of the sound leads to the perception of having a thinner body and
enhances the motivation for physical activity inducing a more dynamic swing and
a shorter heel strike. We here discuss the opportunities and the questions our
findings open.

%X Smartphones and tablets are often used in dynamic environments that force
users to break focus and attend to their surroundings, creating a form of
"situational impairment." Current mobile devices have no ability to sense when
users divert or restore their attention, let alone provide support for resuming
tasks. We therefore introduce SwitchBack, a system that allows mobile device
users to resume tasks more efficiently. SwitchBack is built upon Focus and
Saccade Tracking (FAST), which uses the front-facing camera to determine when
the user is looking and how their eyes are moving across the screen. In a
controlled study, we found that FAST can identify how many lines the user has
read in a body of text within a mean absolute percent error of just 3.9%. We
then tested SwitchBack in a dual focus-of-attention task, finding that
SwitchBack improved average reading speed by 7.7% in the presence of
distractions.

%X In this paper, we present gaze-based bookmarking, EyeBookmark, to mitigate
the deleterious effect of interruption during reading. The key idea of
EyeBookmark is to provide a visual cue to help people decide where to resume
reading. We design four highlighting methods and conduct a controlled user
study with a proof-of-concept design to verify the usefulness of EyeBookmark.
The user study demonstrates not only that participants preferred our
highlighting methods but also that such highlighting methods significantly
reduced the time taken to resume reading after interruption regardless of the
difficulty of text.

%X Chronic multitaskers perform worse on core multitasking skills: memory
management, cognitive filtering and task switching, likely due to their
inability to filter irrelevant stimuli [17]. Our experiment examines effects of
chronic multitasking with task-relevant and irrelevant distractors on
analytical writing quality. We found a general switch cost and, when
controlling for that cost, effects of chronic multitasking habits: heavy
multitaskers write worse essays in the irrelevant condition and better essays
in the relevant condition. Our study changes multitasking research paradigms in
two fundamental ways: it studied a realistic writing scenario including access
to both irrelevant and relevant distractors. We found that the effect of
chronic multitasking is complex; heavy multitaskers are seduced by unrelated
distractors but able to integrate multiple sources of relevant information.

%X In this paper we present a computational cognitive model of task
interruption and resumption, focusing on the effects of the problem state
bottleneck. Previous studies have shown that the disruptiveness of
interruptions is for an important part determined by three factors:
interruption duration, interrupting-task complexity, and moment of
interruption. However, an integrated theory of these effects is still missing.
Based on previous research into multitasking, we propose a first step towards
such a theory in the form of a process model that attributes these effects to
problem state requirements of both the interrupted and the interrupting task.
Subsequently, we tested two predictions of this model in two experiments. The
experiments confirmed that problem state requirements are an important
predictor for the disruptiveness of interruptions. This suggests that
interfaces should be designed to a) interrupt users at low-problem state
moments and b) maintain the problem state for the user when interrupted.

%X Interruptions of knowledge workers are common and can cause a high cost if
they happen at inopportune moments. With recent advances in
psycho-physiological sensors and their link to cognitive and emotional states,
we are interested whether such sensors might be used to measure
interruptibility of a knowledge worker. In a lab and a field study with a total
of twenty software developers, we examined the use of psycho-physiological
sensors in a real-world context. The results show that a Naive Bayes classifier
based on psycho-physiological features can be used to automatically assess
states of a knowledge worker's interruptibility with high accuracy in the lab
as well as in the field. Our results demonstrate the potential of these sensors
to avoid expensive interruptions in a real-world context. Based on brief
interviews, we further discuss the usage of such an interruptibility measure
and interruption support for software developers.

%X We propose iSkin, a novel class of skin-worn sensors for touch input on the
body. iSkin is a very thin sensor overlay, made of biocompatible materials, and
is flexible and stretchable. It can be produced in different shapes and sizes
to suit various locations of the body such as the finger, forearm, or ear.
Integrating capacitive and resistive touch sensing, the sensor is capable of
detecting touch input with two levels of pressure, even when stretched by 30%
or when bent with a radius of 0.5cm. Furthermore, iSkin supports single or
multiple touch areas of custom shape and arrangement, as well as more complex
widgets, such as sliders and click wheels. Recognizing the social importance of
skin, we show visual design patterns to customize functional touch sensors and
allow for a visually aesthetic appearance. Taken together, these contributions
enable new types of on-body devices. This includes finger-worn devices,
extensions to conventional wearable devices, and touch input stickers, all
fostering direct, quick, and discreet input for mobile computing.

%X This paper presents Cyclops, a single-piece wearable device that sees its
user's whole body postures through an ego-centric view of the user that is
obtained through a fisheye lens at the center of the user's body, allowing it
to see only the user's limbs and interpret body postures effectively. Unlike
currently available body gesture input systems that depend on external cameras
or distributed motion sensors across the user's body, Cyclops is a single-piece
wearable device that is worn as a pendant or a badge. The main idea proposed in
this paper is the observation of limbs from a central location of the body.
Owing to the ego-centric view, Cyclops turns posture recognition into a highly
controllable computer vision problem. This paper demonstrates a
proof-of-concept device, and an algorithm for recognizing static and moving
bodily gestures based on motion history images (MHI) and a random decision
forest (RDF). Four example applications of interactive bodily workout, a mobile
racing game that involves hands and feet, a full-body virtual reality system,
and interaction with a tangible toy are presented. The experiment on the bodily
workout demonstrates that, from a database of 20 body workout gestures that
were collected from 20 participants, Cyclops achieved a recognition rate of 79%
using MHI and simple template matching, which increased to 92% with the more
advanced machine learning approach of RDF.

%X Recent mobile phones integrate fingerprint scanners to authenticate users
biometrically and replace passwords, making authentication more convenient for
users. However, due to their cost, capacitive fingerprint scanners have been
limited to top-of-the-line phones, a result of the required resolution and
quality of the sensor. We present Bodyprint, a biometric authentication system
that detects users' biometric features using the same type of capacitive
sensing, but uses the touchscreen as the image sensor instead. While the input
resolution of a touchscreen is 6 dpi, the surface area is larger, allowing the
touch sensor to scan users' body parts, such as ears, fingers, fists, and palms
by pressing them against the display. Bodyprint compensates for the low input
resolution with an increased false rejection rate, but does not compromise on
authentication precision: In our evaluation with 12 participants, Bodyprint
classified body parts with 99.98% accuracy and identifies users with 99.52%
accuracy with a retry likelihood of 26.82% to prevent false positives, thereby
bringing reliable biometric user authentication to a vast number of commodity
devices.

swipe gestures with high accuracy (&gt;92%). NailO works in real-time: we
miniaturized the system to fit on the fingernail, while wirelessly transmitting
the sensor data to a mobile phone or PC. NailO allows one-handed and
always-available input, while being unobtrusive and discrete. Inspired by
commercial nail stickers, the device blends into the user's body, is
customizable, fashionable and even removable. We show example applications of
using the device as a remote controller when hands are busy and using the
system to increase the input space of mobile phones.

%X We propose subtle foot-based gestures named foot plantar-based (FPB)
gestures that are used with sock-placed pressure sensors. In this system, the
user can control a computing device by changing his or her foot plantar
distributions, e.g., pressing the floor with his/her toe. Because such foot
movement is subtle, it is suitable for use especially in a public space such as
a crowded train. In this study, we first conduct a guessability study to design
a user-defined gesture set for interaction with a computing device. Then, we
implement a gesture recognizer with a machine learning technique. To avoid
unexpected gesture activations, we also collect foot plantar pressure patterns
made during daily activities such as walking, as negative training data.
Additionally, we evaluate the unobservability of FPB gestures by using
crowdsourcing. Finally, we conclude with several applications to further
illustrate the utility of FPB gestures.

%X The accurate classification of psychophysiological data is an important
determinant of the quality when interacting with a physiological computing
system. Previous research has focused on classification accuracy of
psychophysiological data in purely mathematical terms but little is known about
how accuracy metrics relate to users' perceptions of accuracy during real-time
interaction. A group of 14 participants watched a series of movie trailers and
were asked to subjectively indicate their level of interest in a binary
high/low fashion. Psychophysiological data (EEG, ECG and SCL) were used to
create a binary classification of interest via a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
algorithm. After a period of training, participants received real-time feedback
from the classification algorithm and perceptions of accuracy were assessed.
The purpose of the study was to compare mathematical classification accuracy
with the perceived accuracy of the system as experienced by the users. Results
indicated that perceived accuracy was subject to a number of psychological
biases resulting from expectations, entrainment and development of trust. The
F1 score was generally a significant predictor of perceived accuracy.

has potential value for brain sensing in HCI user studies. Research has shown
that, although large head movement significantly affects fNIRS data, typical
keyboard use, mouse movement, and non-task-related verbalisations do not affect
measurements during Verbal tasks. This work aims to examine the Reliability of
fNIRS, by 1) confirming these prior findings, and 2) significantly extending
our understanding of how artefacts affect recordings during Spatial tasks,
since much of user interfaces and interaction is inherently spatial. Our
results show that artefacts have a significantly different impact during Verbal
and Spatial tasks. We contribute clearer insights into using fNIRS as a tool
within HCI user studies.

a large amount of code quickly, as they are unable to skim as easily as their
sighted counterparts. To help blind developers overcome this problem, we
present StructJumper, an Eclipse plugin that creates a hierarchical tree based
on the nesting structure of a Java class. The programmer can use the TreeView
to get an overview of the code structure of the class (including all the
methods and control flow statements) and can quickly switch between the
TreeView and the Text Editor to get an idea of where they are within the nested
structure. To evaluate StructJumper, we had seven blind programmers complete
three tasks with and without our tool. We found that the users thought they
would use StructJumper and there was a trend that they were faster completing
the tasks with StructJumper.

%X Data structure algorithms are of fundamental importance in teaching and
software development, yet are difficult to understand. We propose a new
approach for understanding, debugging and developing heap manipulating data
structures. The key technical idea of our work is to combine deep parametric
abstraction techniques emerging from the area of static analysis with
interactive abstraction manipulation. Our approach bridges program analysis
with HCI and enables new capabilities not possible before: i) online automatic
visualization of the data structure in a way which captures its essential
operation, thus enabling powerful local reasoning, and ii) fine grained pen and
touch gestures allowing for interactive control of the abstraction -- at any
point the developer can pause the program, graphically interact with the data,
and continue program execution. These features address some of the most
pressing challenges in developing data structures. We implemented our approach
in a Java-based system called FluiEdt and evaluated it with $27$ developers.
The results indicate that FluiEdt is more effective in helping developers find
data structure errors than existing state of the art IDEs (e.g. Eclipse) or
pure visualization based approaches.

Polymorphic Blocks to represent logical proofs. In this context, if we erase

interpretation, and speculative visions of the home. We articulate dominant
research perspectives in HCI, and we offer two complementary perspectives about

smart domestic environments includes a wealth of human-centered research, the
use of CDR is marginal. Our work demonstrates how such a process engages
residents in activities to imagine why people might value smart domestic
environments and how they might want to interact with them. Through goal

%X Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have introduced "data caps", or quotas on
the amount of data that a customer can download during a billing cycle. Under
this model, Internet users who reach a data cap can be subject to degraded
performance, extra fees, or even temporary interruption of Internet service.
For this reason, users need better visibility into and control over their
Internet usage to help them understand what uses up data and control how these
quotas are reached. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of
a tool, called uCap, to help home users manage Internet data. We conducted a
field trial of uCap in 21 home networks in three countries and performed an
in-depth qualitative study of ten of these homes. We present the results of the
evaluation and implications for the design of future Internet data management

devices while they watch TV. This material, termed companion content, can be
anything from textual information, to interactive quiz games. It can be
delivered throughout a broadcast and often directly relates to specific scenes
in a show. This new scenario has exposed a challenging design space for
creators of both the content and the enabling technology. A key question when
introducing content on a secondary device is how much it detracts from, or
enhances, the show the user is currently engaged with. To examine this, we
investigated methods for mediating attention from the TV and onto a secondary
device. By examining a typical use case we have been able to gain new insights
into how best to design additional stimuli to alert users to companion content
from both a broadcasting, and an HCI perspective.

characteristics of small organizations make it hard for them to effectively use
social media sites. We present findings from interviews with 26 small NPOs'
social media professionals on how they use multiple social media sites to
support public engagement. Small NPOs use multiple social media sites to engage
with different stakeholders toward various ends. However, these NPOs are not
using social media to its full potential with regard to community-building and
action mobilization. Several challenges in small NPOs, such as ineffective
measurement of social media performance, deficient organizational resources,
and lack of control over work, lead to strong tensions between social media
engagement strategies and outcomes. Drawing on these findings, we present
several practical implications for the design of successful public engagement
social media tools.

%X Volunteer campaigns for data collection make it possible for non-profit
organizations to extend their ability to monitor and respond to critical
environmental and societal issues. Yet mobile data collection technologies that
have the potential to lower the costs and increase the accuracy of
volunteer-collected data are not commonly used in these campaigns. In this
paper we conduct a series of studies that reveal the complex issues affecting
technology adoption in this domain. First, we surveyed and interviewed existing
volunteering campaigns to map out current technology usage within volunteer
campaigns. Next, we provided two organizations with a customizable tool for
data collection (Sensr) and studied its use and non-use across six real
volunteer-driven campaigns over six months. Our study explored success and
failure across the first few phases of the campaign lifecycle (campaign
creation, initial deployment, and adoption). Our results highlight the impact
of resource constraints, cognitive factors, the depth of volunteer engagement,
and stakeholders' perspective on technology as important factors contributing
to the adoption and usage of mobile data collection technologies. We use these
findings to argue for specific design features to accelerate the adoption and
use of such tools in volunteer data collection campaigns.

%X This paper identifies the design challenges for creating collaborative
technologies supporting the practices of organizing elections. We
ethnographically investigate the distributed nature of knowledge as enacted
between heterogeneous groups over the course of three elections in Denmark. We
1) identify fundamental characteristics of elections, 2) provide a
comprehensive account of the distributed nature of knowledge in organizing and
executing elections, and 3) point to new challenging areas for human-computer
interaction (HCI) design supporting distributed collaborative knowledge
practices. We found that organizational pattern of elections complicates the
embodiment of nomadic knowledge, which is crucial for managing the effective
organization of an election. Thus, one of the relevant design challenges is
finding out how to support the timely distribution of large amounts of
information, while still ensuring it is appropriately divided and delivered to
various groups participating in planning and executing elections.

%X Contemporary decisions about the management of populations, public services,
security, and the environment are increasingly made through knowledge gleaned
from "big data" and its attendant infrastructures and algorithms. Though often
described as "raw," this data is produced by techniques of measurement that are
imbued with judgments and values that dictate what is counted and what is not,
what is considered the best unit of measurement, and how different things are
grouped together and "made" into a measureable entity. In this paper, we
analyze these politics of measurement and how they relate to action through two
case studies involving high stake public health measurements where experts
intentionally leverage
