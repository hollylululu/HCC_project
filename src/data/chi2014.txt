%X Through our art project, Metaphone, we explored a particular form of
aesthetics referred to in the arts tradition as machine aesthetics. The
Metaphone machine collects the participant's bio-data, Galvanic Skin Response
(GSR) and Heart Rate (HR), creating a process of movement, painting and sound.
The machine behaves in machine-like, aesthetically evocative ways: a shaft on
two large wheels rotates on the floor, carrying paint that is dripped onto a
large sheet of aquarelle paper on the floor according to bio-sensor data. A
soundscape rhythmically follows the bio-sensor data, but also has its own
machine-like sounds. Six commentators were invited to interact with the
machine. They reported a strangely relaxing atmosphere induced by the machine.
Based on these experiences we discuss how different art styles can help to
describe aesthetics in interaction design generally, and how machine aesthetics
in particular can be used to create interesting, sustained, stylistically
coherent interactions.

%X Website aesthetics have been recognized as an influential moderator of
people's behavior and perception. However, what users perceive as "good design"
is subject to individual preferences, questioning the feasibility of universal
design guidelines. To better understand how people's visual preferences differ,
we collected 2.4 million ratings of the visual appeal of websites from nearly
40 thousand participants of diverse backgrounds. We address several gaps in the
knowledge about design preferences of previously understudied groups. Among
other findings, our results show that the level of colorfulness and visual
complexity at which visual appeal is highest strongly varies: Females, for
example, liked colorful websites more than males. A high education level
generally lowers this preference for colorfulness. Russians preferred a lower
visual complexity, and Macedonians liked highly colorful designs more than any
other country in our dataset. We contribute a computational model and estimates
of peak appeal that can be used to support rapid evaluations of website design
prototypes for specific target groups.

%X An experimental study examined whether the effects of aesthetic appeal on
usability test outcomes are moderated by usage domain. The aesthetic appeal of
a cell phone was experimentally manipulated in both home- and work-based usage
domains. The two usage domains were modeled in a usability laboratory. 60
participants completed a series of typical cell phone user tasks. Dependent
measures such as performance, perceived usability, and emotion were taken. The
results showed that aesthetic appeal had a positive effect on perceived
usability but a negative effect on performance. The effects of aesthetic appeal
on usability test outcomes were not moderated by usage domain. The results of
this study imply that it may be sufficient to test dual-domain products in only
one of their usage domains.

%X News articles, reports, blog posts and academic papers often include
graphical charts that serve to visually reinforce arguments presented in the
text. To help readers better understand the relation between the text and the
chart, we present a crowdsourcing pipeline to extract the references between
them. Specifically, we give crowd workers paragraph-chart pairs and ask them to
select text phrases as well as the corresponding visual marks in the chart. We
then apply automated clustering and merging techniques to unify the references
generated by multiple workers into a single set. Comparing the crowdsourced
references to a set of gold standard references using a distance measure based
on the F1 score, we find that the average distance between the raw set of
references produced by a single worker and the gold standard is 0.54 (out of a
max of 1.0). When we apply clustering and merging techniques the average
distance between the unified set of references and the gold standard reduces to
0.39; an improvement of 27%. We conclude with an interactive document viewing
application that uses the extracted references; readers can select phrases in
the text and the system highlights the related marks in the chart.

%X While HCI has focused on multitasking with information workers, we report on
multitasking among Millennials who grew up with digital media -- focusing on
college students. We logged computer activity and used biosensors to measure
stress of 48 students for 7 days for all waking hours, in their in situ
environments. We found a significant positive relationship with stress and
daily time spent on computers. Stress is positively associated with the amount
of multitasking. Conversely, stress is negatively associated with Facebook and
social media use. Heavy multitaskers use significantly more social media and
report lower positive affect than light multitaskers. Night habits affect
multitasking the following day: late-nighters show longer duration of computer
use and those ending their activities earlier in the day multitask less. Our
study shows that college students multitask at double the frequency compared to
studies of information workers. These results can inform designs for stress
management of college students.

%X Recognizing when computer users are stressed can help reduce their
frustration and prevent a large variety of negative health conditions
associated with chronic stress. However, measuring stress non-invasively and
continuously at work remains an open challenge. This work explores the
possibility of using a pressure-sensitive keyboard and a capacitive mouse to
discriminate between stressful and relaxed conditions in a laboratory study.
During a 30 minute session, 24 participants performed several computerized
tasks consisting of expressive writing, text transcription, and mouse clicking.
During the stressful conditions, the large majority of the participants showed
significantly increased typing pressure (&gt;79% of the participants) and more
contact with the surface of the mouse (75% of the participants). We discuss the
potential implications of this work and provide recommendations for future
work.

%X Stress causes and exacerbates many physiological and mental health problems.
Routine and unobtrusive monitoring of stress would enable a variety of
treatments, from break-taking to calming exercises. It may also be a valuable
tool for assessing effects (frustration, difficulty) of using interfaces or
applications. Custom sensing hardware is a poor option, because of the need to
buy/wear/use it continuously, even before stress-related problems are evident.
Here we explore stress measurement from common computer mouse operations. We
use a simple model of arm-hand dynamics that captures muscle stiffness during
mouse movement. We show that the within-subject mouse-derived stress measure is
quite strong, even compared to concurrent physiological sensor measurements.
While our study used fixed mouse tasks, the stress signal was still strong even
when averaged across widely varying task geometries. We argue that mouse
sensing "in the wild" may be feasible, by analyzing frequently-performed
operations of particular geometries.

%X During remote video-mediated assistance, instructors often guide workers
through problems and instruct them to perform unfamiliar or complex operations.
However, the workers' performance might deteriorate due to stress. We argue
that informing biofeedback to the instructor, can improve communication and
lead to lower stress. This paper presents a thorough investigation on mental
workload and stress perceived by twenty participants, paired up in an
instructor-worker scenario, performing remote video-mediated tasks. The
interface conditions differ in task, facial and biofeedback communication. Two
self-report measures are used to assess mental workload and stress. Results
show that pairs reported lower mental workload and stress when instructors are
using the biofeedback as compared to using interfaces with facial view.
Significant correlations were found on task performance with reducing stress
(i.e. increased task engagement and decreased worry) for instructors and
declining mental workload (i.e. increased performance) for workers. Our
findings provide insights to advance video-mediated interfaces for remote
collaborative work.

%X Many users welcome personalized services, but are reluctant to provide the
information about themselves that personalization requires. Performing
personalization exclusively at the client side (e.g., on one's smartphone) may
conceptually increase privacy, because no data is sent to a remote provider.
But does client-side personalization (CSP) also increase users' perception of
privacy?
   We developed a causal model of privacy attitudes and behavior in
personalization, and validated it in an experiment that contrasted CSP with
personalization at three remote providers: Amazon, a fictitious company, and
the "Cloud". Participants gave roughly the same amount of personal data and
tracking permissions in all four conditions. A structural equation modeling
analysis reveals the reasons: CSP raises the fewest privacy concerns, but does
not lead in terms of perceived protection nor in resulting self-anticipated
satisfaction and thus privacy-related behavior. Encouragingly, we found that
adding certain security features to CSP is likely to raise its perceived
protection significantly. Our model predicts that CSP will then also sharply
improve on all other privacy measures.

%X In Apple's iOS 6, when an app requires access to a protected resource (e.g.,
location or photos), the user is prompted with a permission request that she
can allow or deny. These permission request dialogs include space for
developers to optionally include strings of text to explain to the user why
access to the resource is needed. We examine how app developers are using this
mechanism and the effect that it has on user behavior. Through an online survey
of 772 smartphone users, we show that permission requests that include
explanations are significantly more likely to be approved. At the same time,
our analysis of 4,400 iOS apps shows that the adoption rate of this feature by
developers is relatively small: around 19% of permission requests include
developer-specified explanations. Finally, we surveyed 30 iOS developers to
better understand why they do or do not use this feature.

%X Owing to the ever-expanding size of social and professional networks, it is
becoming cumbersome for individuals to configure information disclosure
settings. We used location sharing systems to unpack the nature of
discrepancies between a person's disclosure settings and contextual choices. We
conducted an experience sampling study (N = 35) to examine various factors
contributing to such divergence. We found that immediate feedback about
disclosures without any ability to control the disclosures evoked feelings of
oversharing. Moreover, deviation from specified settings did not always signal
privacy violation; it was just as likely that settings prevented information
disclosure considered permissible in situ. We suggest making feedback more
actionable or delaying it sufficiently to avoid a knee-jerk reaction. Our
findings also make the case for proactive techniques for detecting potential
mismatches and recommending adjustments to disclosure settings, as well as
selective control when sharing location with socially distant recipients and
visiting atypical locations.

%X In order to address the increased privacy and security concerns raised by
mobile communications, designers of mobile applications and websites have come
up with a variety of warnings and appeals. While some interstitials warn about
potential risk to personal information due to an untrusted security
certificate, others attempt to take users' minds away from privacy concerns by
making tempting, time-sensitive offers. How effective are they? We conducted an
online experiment (N = 220) to find out. Our data show that both these
strategies raise red flags for users -- appeals to instant gratification make
users more leery of the site and warnings make them perceive greater threat to
personal data. Yet, users tend to reveal more information about their social
media accounts when warned about an insecure site. This is probably because
users process these interstitials based on cognitive heuristics triggered by
them. These findings hold important implications for the design of cues in
mobile interfaces.

Through a study of 75,747 employees of a large global company over the course

among different forms of social media use and employee performance ratings.

technologies has impacted upon the way in which we coordinate social
group-activities. We present a diary study of 36 individuals that provides an
overview of how group coordination is currently performed as well as the
challenges people face. Our findings highlight that people primarily use
open-channel communication tools (e.g., text messaging, phone calls, email) to
coordinate because the alternatives are seen as either disrupting or curbing to
the natural conversational processes. Yet the use of open-channel tools often
results in conversational overload and a significant disparity of work between
coordinating individuals. This in turn often leads to a sense of frustration
and confusion about coordination details. We discuss how the findings argue for
a significant shift in our thinking about the design of coordination support
systems.

%X When crime analysts collaborate to solve crime cases, they need to share
insights in order to connect the clues, identify a pattern, and attribute the
crime to the right culprit. We designed a collaborative analysis tool to
explore the value of implicitly sharing insights and notes, without requiring
analysts to explicitly push information or request it from each other. In an
experiment, pairs of remote individuals played the role of crime analysts
solving a set of serial killer crimes with both partners having some, but not
all, relevant clues. When implicit sharing of notes was available, participants
remembered more clues related to detecting the serial killer, and they
perceived the tool as more useful compared to when implicit sharing was not
available.

%X Distributed online groups have great potential for generating interdependent
and complex products like encyclopedia articles or product design. However,
coordinating multiple group members to work together effectively while
minimizing process losses remains an open challenge. We conducted an experiment
comparing the effectiveness of two coordination strategies (simultaneous vs.
sequential work) on a complex creative task as the number of group members
increased. Our results indicate that, contrary to prior work, a sequential work
structure was more effective than a simultaneous work structure as the size of
the group increased. A mediation analysis suggests that social processes such
as territoriality partially accounts for these results. A follow up experiment
giving workers specific roles mitigated the detrimental effects of the
simultaneous work structure. These results have implications for small group
theory and crowdsourcing research.

their motion and touch input, and extends their visual and tactile output to
one another. This transforms the watch into an active element that enhances a
wide range of phone-based interactive tasks, and enables a new class of
multi-device gestures and sensing techniques. A technical evaluation shows the
accuracy of these gestures and sensing techniques, and a subjective study on

%X The touch screen interaction paradigm, currently dominant in mobile devices,
begins to fail when very small systems are considered. Specifically, "fat
fingers", a term referring to the fact that users' extremities physically
obstruct their view of screen content and feedback, become particularly
problematic. This paper presents a novel solution for this issue based on
sensing touches to the perpendicular edges of a device featuring a
front-mounted screen. The use of such offset contact points ensures that both a
user's fingers and the device screen remain clearly in view throughout a
targeting operation. The configuration also supports a range of novel
interaction scenarios based on the touch, grip and grasp patterns it affords.
To explore the viability of this concept, this paper describes EdgeTouch, a
small (6 cm) hardware prototype instantiating this multi-touch functionality.
User studies characterizing targeting performance, typical user grasps and
exploring input affordances are presented. The results show that targets of
7.5-22.5 degrees in angular size are acquired in 1.25-1.75 seconds and with
accuracy rates of 3%-18%, promising results considering the small form factor
of the device. Furthermore, grasps made with between two and five fingers are
robustly identifiable. Finally, we characterize the types of input users
envisage performing with EdgeTouch, and report occurrence rates for key
interactions such as taps, holds, strokes and multi-touch and compound input.
The paper concludes with a discussion of the interaction scenarios enabled by
offset sensing.

%X This paper contributes results from an empirical study of on-skin input, an
emerging technique for controlling mobile devices. Skin is fundamentally
different from off-body touch surfaces, opening up a new and largely unexplored
interaction space. We investigate characteristics of the various skin-specific
input modalities, analyze what kinds of gestures are performed on skin, and
study what are preferred input locations. Our main findings show that (1) users
intuitively leverage the properties of skin for a wide range of more expressive
commands than on conventional touch surfaces; (2) established multi-touch
gestures can be transferred to on-skin input; (3) physically uncomfortable
modalities are deliberately used for irreversible commands and expressing
negative emotions; and (4) the forearm and the hand are the most preferred
locations on the upper limb for on-skin input. We detail on users' mental
models and contribute a first consolidated set of on-skin gestures. Our
findings provide guidance for developers of future sensors as well as for
designers of future applications of on-skin input.

vocabulary by distinguishing the areas of users' finger pads contacting the
touchscreen. It requires minimal touch input area and minimal movement, making
it especially ideal for wearable devices such as smart watches and smart
glasses. For example, users of a calculator application on a smart watch could
tap normally to enter numbers, and tap with the right side of their fingers to
enter the operators (e.g., -, =). Results from two human-factor studies showed
that users could tap a touchscreen with five or more distinct areas of their
finger pads. Also, they were able to tap with more distinct areas closer to
their fingertips. We developed a TouchSense smart watch prototype using
inertial measurement sensors, and developed two example applications: a
calculator and a text editor. We also collected user feedback via an

the wrist, they must be small and otherwise unobtrusive, which limits the
sophistication of interactions we can perform. This problem is particularly
acute if the smartwatch relies on a touchscreen for input, as the display is
small and our fingers are relatively large. In this work, we propose a
complementary input approach: using the watch face as a
multi-degree-of-freedom, mechanical interface. We developed a proof of concept
smartwatch that supports continuous 2D panning and twist, as well as binary
tilt and click. To illustrate the potential of our approach, we developed a
series of example applications, many of which are cumbersome -- or even
impossible -- on today's smartwatch devices.

%X The magic lens paradigm, a commonly used descriptor for handheld Augmented
Reality (AR), presents the user with dual views: the augmented view (magic
lens) that appears on the device, and the real view of the surroundings (what
the user can see around the perimeter of the device). The augmented view is
typically implemented by rendering the video captured by the rear-facing camera
directly onto the device's screen. This results in dual perspectives -- the
real world being captured from the device's perspective rather than the user's
perspective (what an observer would see looking through a transparent glass
pane). These differences manifest themselves in misaligned and/or incorrectly
scaled transparency resulting in the dual-view problem.
   This paper presents two user studies comparing (a) device-perspective and
(b) fixed Point-of-View (POV) user-perspective magic lenses to analyze the
effect of the dual-view problem on the use of the surrounding visual context.
The results confirm that the dual-view problem, a result of dual perspective,
has a significant effect on the use of information from the surrounding visual
context. The study also highlights that magnification and not the dual-view
problem is the key factor explaining the correlation between magic lens size
and the increased intensity of the magic lens type effect. From the results, we
derive design guidelines for future magic lenses.

%X We explore the potential of stereoscopic 3D (S3D) vision in offering
distinct gameplay using an S3D-specific game called Deepress3D. Our game
utilizes established S3D design principles for optimizing GUI design, visual
comfort and game mechanics which rely on depth perception in time-pressured
spatial conflicts. The game collects detailed S3D player metrics and allows
players to choose between different, evenly matched strategies. We conducted a
between subjects study comparing S3D and monoscopic versions of Deepress3D that
examined player behavior and performance and measured user-reported data on
presence, simulator sickness, and game experience. Confirming previous results,
stereo users reported higher spatial presence. More importantly, for the first
time, our game metrics indicate that S3D vision can measurably change player
behavior depending on actual game content and level design, without necessarily
affecting performance or emotional experience. These findings indicate the
potential for optimizing applications for stereo users distinguishing them as a
distinct group in HCI research.

%X Blur in images can create the sensation of depth because it emulates an
optical property of the eye; namely, the limited depth of field created by the
eye's lens. When the human eye looks at an object, this object appears sharp on
the retina, but objects at different distances appear blurred. Advances in
gaze-tracking technologies enable us to reproduce dynamic depth of field in
regular displays, providing an alternative way of conveying depth. In this
paper we investigate gaze-contingent depth of field as a method to produce
realistic 3D images, and analyze how effectively people can use it to perceive
depth. We found that GC DOF increases subjective perceived realism and depth
and can contribute to the perception of ordinal depth and distance between
objects, but it is limited in its accuracy.

%X While touch technology has proven its usability for 2D interaction and has
already become a standard input modality for many devices, the challenges to
exploit its applicability with stereoscopically rendered content have barely
been studied. In this paper we exploit the properties of the visual perception
to allow users to touch stereoscopically displayed objects when the input is
constrained to a 2D surface. Therefore, we have extended and generalized recent
evaluations on the user's ability to discriminate small induced object shifts
while reaching out to touch a virtual object, and we propose a practical
interaction technique, the attracting shift technique, suitable for numerous
application scenarios where shallow depth interaction is sufficient. In
addition, our results indicate that slight object shifts during touch
interaction make the virtual scene appear perceptually more stable compared to
a static scene. As a consequence, applications have to manipulate the virtual
objects to make them appear static for the user.

increasing replacement of extraneous hardware devices with compatible software
components. As controls move from hard to soft, we have seen an increase in
usability issues for musicians and sound engineers dealing with a large number
of temporal inputs and both continuous and discrete controls. We present the
SonicExplorer application, which we developed to give users a new interface for
exploring and manipulating audio. SonicExplorer leverages users' spatial and
color perception to enhance exploration by visualizing the parameter space and
providing implicit memory cues. The application also leverages bimanual input
to aid in fluid exploration of multidimensional audio parameter spaces, and to
minimize the need for switching between parameters.

%X In this paper we present a system that allows to "touch", grab and
manipulate sounds in mid-air. Further, arbitrary objects can seem to emit
sound. We use spatial sound reproduction for sound rendering and computer
vision for tracking. Using our approach, sounds can be heard from anywhere in
the room and always appear to originate from the same (possibly moving)
position, regardless of the listener's position. We demonstrate that direct
"touch" interaction with sound is an interesting alternative to indirect
interaction mediated through controllers or visual interfaces. We show that
sound localization is surprisingly accurate (11.5 cm), even in the presence of
distractors. We propose to leverage the ventriloquist effect to further
increase localization accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how affordances of real
objects can create synergies of auditory and visual feedback. As an application
of the system, we built a spatial music mixing room.

%X Traditional audio editing tools do not facilitate the task of separating a
single mixture recording (e.g. pop song) into its respective sources (e.g.
drums, vocal, etc.). Such ability, however, would be very useful for a wide
variety of audio applications such as music remixing, audio denoising, and
audio-based forensics. To address this issue, we present ISSE -- an interactive
source separation editor. ISSE is a new open-source, freely available, and
cross-platform audio editing tool that enables a user to perform source
separation by painting on time-frequency visualizations of sound, resulting in
an interactive machine learning system. The system brings to life our
previously proposed interaction paradigm and separation algorithm that learns
from user-feedback to perform separation. For evaluation, we conducted user
studies and compared results between inexperienced and expert users. For a
variety of real-world tasks, we found that inexperienced users can achieve good
separation quality with minimal instruction and expert users can achieve
state-of-the-art separation quality.

%X Listening and interacting with audio commonly relies on using earphones
which limit the ability of users to perceive their auditory environment.
Earphone sets that integrate miniature microphones on their exterior can,
however, be used to hear-through the auditory environment. We present an
evaluation study in which sound localization when wearing such a hear-through
system is compared to normal earphones, open headphones and unblocked ears.
Although localization performance is improved compared to open headphones, we
find that it is compromised in comparison to listening without earphones
because confusions of sound direction increase and localization judgment
distributions are more dispersed and show a weaker correlation to the test
directions. The implications of the results to human computer interaction and
possible improvements to hear-through system design are discussed.

interaction and interactive applications. The design aimed at critical
reflection and inspiration among users, rather than achieving a certain kind of
persuasion. This guided the practical design to be modelled around
open-endedness and social voices to challenge ideas and points of view. We
argue that research addressing design for interactions about value-laden
concepts such as sustainable action need to find ways of supporting various
knowledge discourses, by distinguishing between performative and
representational technologies. The approach allowed us to identify a number of
design challenges regarding interactive technology and interaction design in
relation to aspects of knowledge and truth, trust, negotiation and

%X If the people belong to multiple online communities, their joint membership
can influence the survival of each of the communities to which they belong.
Communities with many joint memberships may struggle to get enough of their
members' time and attention, but find it easy to import best practices from
other communities. In this paper, we study the effects of membership overlap on
the survival of online communities. By analyzing the historical data of 5673
Wikia communities, we find that higher levels of membership overlap are
positively associated with higher survival rates of online communities.
Furthermore, we find that it is beneficial for young communities to have shared
members who play a central role in other mature communities. Our contributions
are two-fold. Theoretically, by examining the impact of membership overlap on
the survival of online communities we identified an important mechanism
underlying the success of online communities. Practically, our findings may
guide community creators on how to effectively manage their members, and tool
designers on how to support this task.

there has been little direct study of goals. We analyze novel data
characterizing the goals of enterprise online communities, assessing the
importance of goals for leaders, how goals influence member perceptions of
community value, and how goals relate to success measures proposed in the
literature. We find that most communities have multiple goals and common goals
are learning, reuse of resources, collaboration, networking, influencing
change, and innovation. Leaders and members agree that all of these goals are
important, but their perceptions of success on goals do not align with each
other, or with commonly used behavioral success measures. We conclude that
simple behavioral measures and leader perceptions are not good success metrics,
and propose alternatives based on specific goals members and leaders judge most
important.

%X Online communities serve various important functions, but many fail to
thrive. Research on community success has traditionally focused on internal
factors. In contrast, we take an ecological view to understand how the success
of a community is influenced by other communities. We measured a community's
relationship with other communities -- its "niche" -- through four dimensions:
topic overlap, shared members, content linking, and shared offline
organizational affiliation. We used a mixed-method approach, combining the
quantitative analysis of 9495 online enterprise communities and interviews with
community members. Our results show that too little or too much overlap in
topic with other communities causes a community's activity to suffer. We also
show that this main result is moderated in predictable ways by whether the
community shares members with, links to content in, or shares an organizational
affiliation with other communities. These findings provide new insight on
community success, guiding online community designers on how to effectively
position their community in relation to others.

gatekeeping socialization breaks down. Snuggle supports positive socialization
by helping mentors quickly find newcomers whose good-faith mistakes were
reverted as damage. Snuggle also supports ideological critique and reflection
by bringing visibility to the consequences of viewing newcomers through a lens

animators create animations with standardized digital authoring software.
However, the results tend to lack the individualism or atmosphere of physical

have limited experience in animation. To incorporate their skills, we present a
workflow that integrates the offline painting and digital animation creation
processes in a labor-saving manner. First, a user makes a rough sketch of the
visual elements and defines their movements using our digital authoring
software with a sketch interface. Then these images are exported to printed
pages, and users can paint using offline physical media. Finally, the work is
scanned and imported back into the digital content, forming a composite
animation that combines digital and physical media. We present an
implementation of this system to demonstrate its workflow. We also discuss the
advantages of using physical media in digital animations through design
evaluations.

challenges, we first conducted a literature review, identifying 14 behaviors
that occur during informal design. We then designed an interactive whiteboard
system to support all of these behaviors and deployed the system to three
groups of designers. Through usage logs and interviews, we examined the effects
of interactivity on whiteboard use across a wide spectrum of design behaviors,
identifying ways in which interactive whiteboards support the practices used in
physical whiteboards and where they enable designers to work more effectively.

creative expression by supporting a workflow of searching, editing, and

it into the overall drawing. Serendipitous discovery of shapes is facilitated
by allowing multiple exploration channels, such as doodles, shape filtering,
and relaxed search. Results from a qualitative evaluation show that Juxtapoze
makes the process of creating image compositions enjoyable and supports

motions to object collections. We propose a framework built around kinetic
textures, which provide continuous animation effects while preserving the
unique timeless nature of still illustrations. This enables many dynamic
effects difficult or not possible with previous sketch-based tools, such as a
school of fish swimming, tree leaves blowing in the wind, or water rippling in

among players, in particular heatmaps since they allow them to reenact the

of a user study conducted with 29 players (i) to investigate how players use
heatmaps and two further graphical representations that use clustering
algorithms to interpret gameplay and (ii) to assess the three representations
in regard to time efficiency, correctness, suitability, and player preference.
Our results show that heatmaps were mainly used to detect hot spots while the
cluster representations proved useful to compare variables, allowing the
players to uncover relationships between them and in turn allowing a deeper

building up the gaming experiences that people have. Whilst there is
substantial work on innovative controllers for consoles, like the XBox Kinect,
relatively little has been done to understand the effect of the different
control mechanisms that can be used to play games on mobile devices like
smartphones. A well-defined framework of naturalness has emerged as potentially
useful concept in area of game controllers. This paper reports two experiments
that look at how the naturalness of the game controls influences the experience
of immersion in mobile games. It seems that where there is an a prior natural
mapping, this will improve immersion in the game but in the absence of a prior
mapping, naturalness alone is not sufficient to account for immersion. This
opens up the need for a more thorough investigation of this area.

video games but suffer from a lack of objectivity and timeliness. On the other
hand, quantitative captures of physiological data are effective; providing
detailed, unbiased and continuous responses of players, but lack contexts for
interpretation. This paper documents how both approaches could be used together
in practice by comparing video-cued retrospective think-aloud data and
physiological data collected during a video gameplay experiment. We observed
that many interesting physiological responses did not feature in participants'
think-aloud data, and conversely, reports of interesting experiences were
sometimes not observed in the collected physiological data. Through learnings
from our experiment, we present some of the challenges when combining these
approaches and offer some guidelines as to how qualitative and quantitative

bounce-back and a state that only persists during interaction. Three empirical
studies are described that evaluate pressure for use as a non-dominant hand
input modality, where the ability to target and maintain pressure while
simultaneously performing a dominant-hand targeting task is investigated.
Pressure accuracy was high (93%) and the impact on dominant-hand targeting was
low. Mean pressure accuracy when selecting targets by releasing pressure was
also high (89%) as was selecting targets by applying pressure from a non-zero
starting point (94.4%). The ability to accurately maintain pressure over time
was better with larger target pressures. Example applications and design
guidelines are presented that enable designers to exploit the transient
properties of pressure input in interaction design.

%X We present VacuumTouch, a novel haptic interface architecture for touch
screens that provides attractive force feedback to the user's finger.
VacuumTouch consists of an air pump and solenoid air valves that connect to the
surface of the touch screen and suck the air above the surface where the user's
finger makes contact. VacuumTouch does not require the user to hold or attach
additional devices to provide the attractive force, which allows for easy
interaction with the surface. This paper introduces the implementation of the
VacuumTouch architecture and some applications for enhancement of the graphical
user interface, namely a suction button, a suction slider, and a suction dial.
The quantitative evaluation was conducted with the suction dial and showed that
the attractive force provided by VacuumTouch improved the performance of the
dial menu interface and its potential effects. At the end of this paper, we
discuss the current prototype's advantages and limitations, as well as possible
improvements and potential capabilities.

%X This paper investigates users' ability to perform force-sensitive tapping
and explores its potential as an input modality in touch-based systems. We
study force-sensitive tapping using Expressive Touch, a tabletop interface that
infers tapping force from the sound waves created by the users' finger upon
impact. The first part of the paper describes the implementation details of
Expressive Touch and shows how existing tabletop interfaces can be augmented to
reliably detect tapping force across the entire surface. The second part of the
paper reports on the results of three studies of force-sensitive tapping.
First, we use a classic psychophysic task to gain insights into participants'
perception of tapping force (Study 1). Results show that although participants
tap with different absolute tapping forces, they have a similar perception of
relative tapping force. Second, we investigate participants' ability to control
tapping force (Study 2) and find that users can produce two force levels with
99% accuracy. For six levels of force, accuracy drops to 58%. Third, we
investigate the usability of force tapping by studying participants' reactions
to seven force-sensitive touch applications (Study 3).

operations that enriches common multi-finger gestures with pressure
information. By using the initially applied pressure level for implicit mode
switching, a gesture can be enhanced with different functionalities to enlarge
the interaction space for multi-touch. To evaluate the feasibility of our
concept, we conducted an experiment, which indicates good human sensorimotor
skills for performing multi-touch gestures with a few number of pressure levels
and without any additional feedback. Based on the experimental results, we
discuss implications for the design of pressure-sensitive multi-touch gestures,
and propose application scenarios that make optimal use of our concept.

We conducted a study of combining gaze gestures with vibrotactile feedback.
Gaze gestures were used as an input method in a mobile device and vibrotactile
feedback as a new alternative way to give confirmation of interaction events.
Our results show that vibrotactile feedback significantly improved the use of
gaze gestures. The tasks were completed faster and rated easier and more
comfortable when vibrotactile feedback was provided.

%X In this paper, we discuss how a flourishing scene of DIY makers is turning
visions of tangible and ubiquitous computing into products. Drawing on
long-term multi-sited ethnographic research and active participation in DIY
making, we provide insights into the social, material, and economic processes
that undergird this transition from prototypes to products. The contribution of
this paper is three-fold. First, we show how DIY maker practice is illustrative
of a broader "return to" and interest in physical materials. This has
implications for HCI research that investigates questions of materiality.
Second, we shed light on how hackerspaces and hardware start-ups are
experimenting with new models of manufacturing and entrepreneurship. We argue
that we have to take seriously these maker practices, not just as hobbyist or
leisure practice, but as a professionalizing field functioning in parallel to
research and industry labs. Finally, we end with reflections on the role of HCI
researchers and designers as DIY making emerges as a site of HCI innovation. We
argue that HCI is positioned to provide critical reflection, paired with a
sensibility for materials, tools and design methods.

%X This paper describes an integrated program of theoretical, ethnographic, and
building work meant to explore post-humanist alternatives to questions around
HCI creativity and design. We review recent theories in the humanities, social
sciences, and HCI that argue for different ways of framing the relationship
between human agents and the object world around them. We then describe a
program of ethnographic work with artists who feature found and broken
technologies as central methods and topics of work. Finally, we describe an
installation and self-study project of our own, 'Scale,' that extends these
lines of analysis through collaborative acts of building with broken and
discarded technologies. We argue that such integrated programs of work offer
one useful model for leveraging the theoretical, ethnographic and material
dimensions of HCI work; and that the distinct 'propensities' of found and
broken objects can challenge and extend HCI notions of creativity and design
itself.

%X This paper considers the design, construction, and example use of a new type
of 3D printer which fabricates three-dimensional objects from soft fibers (wool
and wool blend yarn). This printer allows the substantial advantages of
additive manufacturing techniques (including rapid turn-around prototyping of
physical objects and support for high levels of customization and
configuration) to be employed with a new class of material. This material is a
form of loose felt formed when fibers from an incoming feed of yarn are
entangled with the fibers in layers below it. The resulting objects recreate
the geometric forms specified in the solid models which specify them, but are
soft and flexible -- somewhat reminiscent in character to hand knitted
materials. This extends 3D printing from typically hard and precise forms into
a new set of forms which embody a different aesthetic of soft and imprecise
objects, and provides a new capability for researchers to explore the use of
this class of materials in interactive devices.

%X Cultures of making -- that is, social practices of hacking, DIY, tinkering,
repair, and craft -- continue to rise in prominence, and design researchers
have taken note, because of their implications for sustainability,
democratization, and alternative models of innovation, design, participation,
and education. We contribute to this agenda by exploring our findings on
self-made tools, which we encountered in a 9-month ethnographic study of a
hackerspace. Self-made tools embody issues raised in two discourses that are of
interest in design research on making: tools and adhocism. In this paper, we
explore ways that tools and adhocism interface with each other, using our
findings as a material to think with. We find that this juxtaposition of
concepts helps explain a highly generative creative practice -- tool-making --
within the hackerspace we studied.

%X The rapid adoption of smartphones along with a growing habit for using these
devices as alarm clocks presents an opportunity to use this device as a sleep
detector. This adds value to UbiComp and personal informatics in terms of user
context and new performance data to collect and visualize, and it benefits
healthcare as sleep is correlated with many health issues. To assess this
opportunity, we collected one month of phone sensor and sleep diary entries
from 27 people who have a variety of sleep contexts. We used this data to
construct models that detect sleep and wake states, daily sleep quality, and
global sleep quality. Our system classifies sleep state with 93.06% accuracy,
daily sleep quality with 83.97% accuracy, and overall sleep quality with 81.48%
accuracy. Individual models performed better than generally trained models,
where the individual models require 3 days of ground truth data and 3 weeks of
ground truth data to perform well on detecting sleep and sleep quality,
respectively. Finally, the features of noise and movement were useful to infer
sleep quality.

research within HCI and ubiquitous computing. The emergence of commercial
wearable devices for tracking health- and fitness-related activities arguably
represents the first widespread adoption of dedicated ubiquitous persuasive
technology. The recent ubiquity of commercial systems allows us to learn about
their value and use in truly "in the wild" contexts and understand how
practices evolve over long-term, naturalistic use. We present a study with 30
participants who had adopted wearable activity-tracking devices of their own
volition and had continued to use them for between 3 and 54 months. The
findings, which both support and contrast with those of previous research,
paint a picture of the evolving benefits and practices surrounding these
emerging technologies over long periods of use. They also serve as the basis
for design implications for personal informatics technologies for long-term
health and fitness support.

%X In recent years much research work has been dedicated to detecting user
activity patterns from sensor data such as location, movement and proximity.
However, how daily activities are correlated to people's happiness (such as
their satisfaction from work and social lives) is not well explored. In this
work, we propose an approach to investigate the relationship between users'
daily activity patterns and their life satisfaction level. From a well-known
longitudinal dataset collected by mobile devices, we extract various activity
features through location and proximity information, and compute the entropies
of these data to capture the regularities of the behavioral patterns of the
participants. We then perform component analysis and structural equation
modeling to identify key behavior contributors to self-reported satisfaction
scores. Our results show that our analytical procedure can identify meaningful
assumptions of causality between activities and satisfaction. Particularly,
keeping regularity in daily activities can significantly improve the life
satisfaction.

%X Governments and other organisations often rely on data collected by
household surveys and censuses to identify areas in most need of regeneration
and development projects. However, due to the high cost associated with the
data collection process, many developing countries conduct such surveys very
infrequently and include only a rather small sample of the population, thus
failing to accurately capture the current socio-economic status of the
country's population. In this paper, we address this problem by means of a
methodology that relies on an alternative source of data from which to derive
up to date poverty indicators, at a very fine level of spatio-temporal
granularity. Taking two developing countries as examples, we show how to
analyse the aggregated call detail records of mobile phone subscribers and
extract features that are strongly correlated with poverty indexes currently
derived from census data.

we identify a pervasive lack of understanding in existing literature, which
raises an important research question: how can we build social capital where
little social capital exists? We conducted a preliminary study to explore
whether and if so, how, individuals in an economically distressed population
with limited social capital use technologies to increase social capital and
achieve socio-economic security. We contribute details about barriers affecting
social capital (e.g., difficulties finding and making the right connections and
an overall lack of trust within communities). We also suggest ways in which
ICTs can assist populations that could benefit most from increased social
capital and economic security.

%X Authors use icon encodings to indicate the semantics of categorical
information in visualizations. The default icon libraries found in
visualization tools often do not match the semantics of the data. Users often
manually search for or create icons that are more semantically meaningful. This
process can hinder the flow of visual analysis, especially when the amount of
data is large, leading to a suboptimal user experience. We propose a technique
for automatically generating semantically relevant icon encodings for
categorical dimensions of data points. The algorithm employs natural language
processing in order to find relevant imagery from the Internet. We evaluate our
approach on Mechanical Turk by generating large libraries of icons using
Tableau Public workbooks that represent real analytical effort by people out in
the world. Our results show that the automatic algorithm does nearly as well as
the manually created icons, and particularly has higher user satisfaction for
larger cardinalities of data.

%X Many visualization tasks require the viewer to make judgments about
aggregate properties of data. Recent work has shown that viewers can perform
such tasks effectively, for example to efficiently compare the maximums or
means over ranges of data. However, this work also shows that such
effectiveness depends on the designs of the displays. In this paper, we explore
this relationship between aggregation task and visualization design to provide
guidance on matching tasks with designs. We combine prior results from
perceptual science and graphical perception to suggest a set of design
variables that influence performance on various aggregate comparison tasks. We
describe how choices in these variables can lead to designs that are matched to
particular tasks. We use these variables to assess a set of eight different
designs, predicting how they will support a set of six aggregate time series
comparison tasks. A crowd-sourced evaluation confirms these predictions. These
results not only provide evidence for how the specific visualizations support
various tasks, but also suggest using the identified design variables as a tool
for designing visualizations well suited for various types of tasks.

result, system responsiveness is increased and the user experience is improved.

treat data as full populations. Uncertain visualizations are good at
representing data distributions emerging from samples, but are more limited in
allowing users to carry out decision tasks. This is because tasks that are
simple on a traditional chart (e.g. "compare two bars") become a complex
probabilistic task on a chart with uncertainty. We present guidelines for
creating visual annotations for solving tasks with uncertainty, and an
implementation that addresses five core tasks on a bar chart. A preliminary
user study shows promising results: that users have a justified confidence in
their answers with our system.

%X Online crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter are gaining attention among
novice creatives as an effective platform for funding their ventures and
engaging in creative work with others. However, a focus on financial success of
crowdfunding has obscured the fact that over 58% of crowdfunding projects fail
to achieve their funding goals. This population of failed creatives however,
gives us an audience to study public creative failure in an online environment.
We draw inspiration from work in organizational behavior on failure, and work
in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) on online behavior, to study online public
failure. Using a mixed-methods approach with data scraped from Kickstarter and
interview data with failed crowdfunding project creators, we answer the
following question: What do project creators on crowdfunding platforms learn
and change through the process of failing? We find that creators who relaunch
their projects succeed 43% of the time, and that most individuals find failure
to be a positive experience. We conclude the paper with a series of design
implications for future creative platforms where public failure is part of the
creative process.

types of project updates created during campaigns, and found discrepancies
between the design intent of a project update and the various uses in practice
(e.g. social promotion). The analysis also showed that specific uses of updates
had stronger associations with campaign success than the project's description.
Design implications were formulated from the results to help designers better
support various uses of updates in crowdfunding campaigns.

%X This paper introduces the concept of crowd storage, the idea that digital
files can be stored and retrieved later from the memories of people in the
crowd. Similar to human memory, crowd storage is ephemeral, which means that
storage is temporary and the quality of the stored information degrades over
time. Crowd storage may be preferred over storing information directly in the
cloud, or when it is desirable for information to degrade inline with normal
human memories. To explore and validate this idea, we created WeStore, a system
that stores and then later retrieves digital files in the existing memories of
crowd workers. WeStore does not store information directly, but rather encrypts
the files using details of the existing memories elicited from individuals
within the crowd as cryptographic keys. The fidelity of the retrieved
information is tied to how well the crowd remembers the details of the memories
they provided. We demonstrate that crowd storage is feasible using an existing
crowd marketplace (Amazon Mechanical Turk), explore design considerations
important for building systems that use crowd storage, and outline ideas for
future research in this area.

%X Musical soundtracks will be important features of future locative
experiences from tours to games. We present a study designed to uncover
potential relationships between higher-level musical structures such as
harmony, melody, timbre, dynamic intensity and punctuation and users' spatial
experiences. We observed twenty-two participants exploring an open field while
listening to four contrasting musical compositions, and then interviewed them
afterwards. We report their different approaches to interpreting the music,
strategies for mapping zones, choice of stopping destinations, and their
awareness and appreciation of the music. Our discussion of these findings in
relation to the literature leads us to propose six initial principles to guide
the composition of mobile and locative soundtracks, and also to articulate a
three-layer framework of global, regional and local attachment to help guide
the attachment of musical features to different regions within a locative
experience.

%X Audio augmented reality systems overlay the physical world with a virtual
audio space. Today's smartphones provide enough processing power to create the
impression of virtual sound sources being located in the real world. To achieve
this, information about the user's location and orientation is necessary which
requires additional hardware. In a real-world installation, however, we
observed that instead of turning their head to localize sounds, users tend to
turn their entire body. Therefore, we suggest to simply measure orientation of
the user's body -- or even just the mobile device she is holding -- to generate
the spatial audio.
   To verify this approach, we present two studies: Our first study in examines
the user's head, body, and mobile device orientation when moving through an
audio augmented reality system in a lab setting. Our second study analyzes the
user experience in a real-world installation when using head, body, or device
orientation to control the audio spatialization. We found that when navigating
close to sound sources head tracking is necessary, but that it can potentially
be replaced by device tracking in larger or more explorative usage scenarios.
These findings help reduce the technical complexity of mobile audio augmented
reality systems (MAARS), and enable their wider dissemination as mobile
software-only apps.

%X The designers of mobile guides for museums and galleries face three major
challenges: fostering rich interpretation, delivering deep personalization, and
enabling a coherent social visit. We propose an approach to tackling all three
simultaneously by inviting visitors to design an interpretation that is
specifically tailored for a friend or loved one that they then experience
together. We describe a trial of this approach at a contemporary art gallery,
revealing how visitors designed personal and sometimes provocative experiences
for people they knew well. We reveal how pairs of visitors negotiated these
experiences together, showing how our approach could deliver intense
experiences for both, but also required them to manage social risk. By
interpreting our findings through the lens of 'gift giving' we shed new light
on ongoing explorations of interpretation, personalization and social visiting
within HCI.

access background information on artworks in mobile museum guide applications
(apps) by means of a field experiment. While museums and previous research have
explored technical aspects, it is unclear whether visitors actually want to use
VisRec. A prototype featuring VisRec, QR codes and number codes was developed
and assessed with a usability study in two museums (N=89). The prototype
confirms the efficacy of the recently introduced ORB-algorithm for VisRec.
Compared to previous literature, the results highlight the context-dependency
of perceived usability and variability in the importance of usability factors.
The results reveal a clear preference for VisRec among participants (53%); only
14% preferred QR codes. Ease of use, enjoyability and distance are identified
as the main factors. This provides strong evidence to further explore the
potential of VisRec to improve visitors' museum experiences.

%X Barcodes are all around us -- on books, groceries and other products -- but
these everyday markers are typically used for a single focused purpose. In this
paper we explore the concept of "piggybacking" on ubiquitous markers to
facilitate indoor navigation. Our initial probe -- BookMark -- allows library
visitors to scan any nearby book to provide a custom map to the location of a
desired item. In contrast to previous indoor navigation systems, our approach
repurposes existing markers on physical items that are already in the
navigation space, meaning that no additional infrastructure is required. We
evaluated the BookMark probe in a large university library, showing its
potential with real library users. In addition, we illustrate how the general
technique shows further potential in other similar barcode-rich environments.

%X Gaining an understanding of user needs is a central component of HCI design
approaches such as user-centred design and participatory design. In some
settings, such as mental health care, access to end-users is often constrained.
This is a particular difficulty given that the experience of those with mental
illness can be difficult for researchers to understand, and is further
complicated by its associated stigma. In addition, the therapeutic setting is
outside the common experience of most people and protected from outside
intrusion. Although role-play has been used in varied ways in HCI, rarely has
it been defined with sufficient clarity to enable others to deploy it in a
nuanced manner. We argue that role-play is particularly suited for use in
mental healthcare settings and, when used judiciously, can address some of the
difficulties associated with working in this setting. This paper details a
range of role-play formats appropriated from therapeutic role-play, drawing
upon the HCI and mental health literature, therapist input and our experience
of using role-play for a number of purposes at different stages of the
development process. We consider how and why role-play can be used to generate
empathy, gain understanding of therapy, provide feedback on designs before
clinical use and help train therapists in using technology in the treatment
room.

work has explored the role of social support in CMC environments, less analysis
has considered social support in mobile health systems. This paper describes
socially supportive messages in VERA, a mobile application for sharing health
decisions and behaviors. The short and bursty interactions in social awareness
streams [36] afford a particular style of social support, for which we offer
the label staccato social support. Results indicate that, in comparison to
previous work, staccato social support is characterized by a greater prevalence
of esteem support, which builds respect and confidence. We further note the
presence of 'following up', a positive behavior that contributes to supportive
interactions, likely via social pressure and accountability [7,38]. These
findings suggest design recommendations to developers of mobile social support
systems and contribute to understanding technologically mediated social support
for health.

%X Health information management for cancer care is a challenging and personal
process that changes over time based on one's needs, goals, and health status.
While technologies supporting health information management appear promising,
we do not fully understand how health information tools fit into patients?
daily lives. To better understand the opportunities and usage barriers of these
tools, we designed and deployed a mobile, tablet-based health management aid:
My Journey Compass. After one month of use, we interviewed twelve breast cancer
patients to investigate their initial patterns of adoption, adaptation, use and
non-use. We found that developing a tool that was customizable, mobile, and
integrated into the patients' healthcare system resulted in a set of surprising
uses by breast cancer patients for a wide variety of tasks. Our study
demonstrates the potential for health management tools to improve the cancer
care experience and for HCI research to influence existing healthcare systems.

clinicians at a rehabilitation hospital, focusing here on the final usability
study. From our wide-ranging design-research activities, which may be
characterized as research through design, we found ART to be promising but also
challenging. As a design exemplar, ART offers invaluable lessons to the CHI
community as it comes to design larger-scale, cyber-physical artifacts
cultivating interactions across people and their surroundings that define
places of social, cultural and psychological significance.

Experience Design Theatre (EDT) as an approach to undertaking
experience-centered design with multiple parties in the early stages of design.
EDT was motivated by a need to involve several diverse groups of people in the
design of a digitally coordinated care service -- NetCarers. We used live
theatre as a way to engage small groups of participants in dialogues around the
design of NetCarers, to qualify their contributions in a refined performance,
and to communicate their concerns and aspirations to domain experts. We
highlight key benefits to using live theatre in experience-centered design and
offer insights for researchers undertaking similar work in the future.

%X Conventional wisdom says that to be successful, an idea must be concrete,
complete, and certain. However, what if unfinished ideas work? This CHI paper
proposes a new design space we call non-finito products for the HCI community.
This new design space is about intentionally unfinished products and how they
foster new creations by end-users as they are actually used to help people
solve their own problems. The central idea comes from the background of the
growing complexity associated with IT advancement and from the new way of
dealing with it, with the assistance of user creativity in the actual use of
the products. This paper begins with the exploration of non-finito products as
a new design space for the end-user's creativity in the personal user
experience. We then defined and proposed non-finito products. We discussed
three case studies that will help to understand the design space of non-finito
products, and we framed the new design space by revealing the beneficial
contexts and values. Finally, we suggested the implications of designing
non-finito products. We believe that non-finito products will open a new design
space in HCI, prompt a new means of replacing value-destroying complexity with
value-creating version, and help to make a product better fit to user
experience.

and considers "Design Fiction" as a technique for exploring the potential value
of new design work. It begins with an analysis of Research through Design
abstracts in the ACM digital library and identifies an emerging language and
structure of papers in this emerging field. The abstracts: frame a problem
space, introduce a study, often involving the deployment of a prototype, and
conclude with considerations, reflections and discussion. This format is then
pastiched in a series of design fictions written for a project investigating
new and emerging forms of reproduction in Art. The fictions take the form of
"imaginary abstracts" which summarize findings of papers that have not been
written about prototypes that do not exist. It is argued that framing concept
designs as fictional studies can provide a space for research focused critique
and development.

%X Absolute indirect interaction maps the absolute position of a device's
end-effector to the absolute position of a remote on-screen object. Despite its
long-time use with graphics tablets and growing use in research prototypes,
little is known on the influence of form factors and input conditions on
pointing performance with such a mapping. The input and display can have
different sizes and aspect ratios, for example. The on-screen targets can vary
in size. Users can look solely at the display or at the input device as well.
They can also hold the input device in certain cases, or let it rest on a
table. This paper reports on two experiments designed to investigate the
influence of all these factors on absolute indirect-touch pointing performance.
We also provide design guidelines for interaction in these situations based on
the observed impacting factors.

%X We present the Bubble Lens, a new target acquisition technique that remedies
the limitations of the Bubble Cursor to increase the speed and accuracy of
acquiring small, dense targets -- precisely those targets for which the Bubble
Cursor degenerates to a point cursor. When targets are large and sparse, the
Bubble Lens behaves like the Bubble Cursor. But when targets are small and
dense, the Bubble Lens automatically magnifies nearby targets, making them
larger in both visual- and motor-space. Importantly, magnification is not
governed by an explicit user-invoked mode-switch. Rather, magnification is
activated through kinematic triggering, a technique that continuously examines
an unfolding velocity profile to automatically trigger mode changes based on
observed features. In a first study, we found the Bubble Cursor performed
poorly when targets had an effective size smaller than 10 pixels. Using this
threshold for the Bubble Lens in a second study, we found that the Bubble Lens
significantly outperformed the Bubble Cursor, decreasing movement time by 10.2%
and error rates by 37.9%, making the Bubble Lens the fastest current pointing
technique.

%X We present a new method of predicting the endpoints of mouse movements.
While prior approaches to endpoint prediction have relied upon normative
kinematic laws, regression, or control theory, our approach is straightforward
but kinematically rich. Our key insight is to regard the unfolding velocity
profile of a pointing movement as a 2-D stroke gesture and to use template
matching to predict the endpoint based on prior observed movements. We call our
technique kinematic template matching (KTM), which is simple to implement,
user-adaptable, and kinematically expressive. In a study of 17 able-bodied
participants evaluated over movement amplitudes ranging from 100-800 pixels, we
found KTM to predict endpoints that were within 83 pixels of the true endpoint
at 50% of the way through the movement, within 48 pixels at 75%, and within 39
pixels at 90%, using 1000 templates per participant. These accuracies make KTM
as successful an approach to endpoint prediction as any prior technique, while
being easier to implement and understand than most.

%X We present the Implicit Fan Cursor (IFC) -- a novel target pointing
technique using a cursor with a fan-shape activation area. The IFC couples the
cursor's activation area with its velocity, i.e., the speed and direction of
the mouse motion, behaving like a 2D spotlight cursor at low speed and a
circular area cursor at high speed. Thus, it enables the user to precisely
acquire distant targets at low speed and easily acquire nearest targets at high
speed, without explicit mode switching. This technique minimizes cursor
movement, while taking into consideration of the precision of cursor movement
at different speeds. It also ensures that only one target is captured at any
time. The results of our controlled experiments show that the IFC outperforms
the point cursor and the area cursor techniques, particularly in terms of
cursor moving distance, and that its performance can be accurately modeled
using the Fitts' law.

%X Constant connectivity and total availability to clients is the rule rather
than the exception in many contemporary workplaces. Enabled by developments in
information and communication technologies (ICTs), total availability of
employees is possible and presumed. Scholars have explored how new
technological affordances, cultural shifts, individual personality traits,
and/or the development of social expectations that reinforce norms of constant
connectivity have led to this state of affairs. We argue that a key factor has
been overlooked in current scholarship about stress, intensive work, and
constant connectivity. That is, current economic conditions are creating a
marketplace in which firms increasing sell the availability of their employees
as part of the services offered by the firm. In this paper we use qualitative
data to illustrate how total availability is an integral aspect of the
'product' offered by professional service firms and is becoming increasingly
prevalent in other service industries. We conclude with a discussion of how the
HCI community might address this situation as a design challenge. Drawing on
the work of Goffman and Perlow, we suggest that designers attend to the ways in
which organizations might maintain front stage impressions of total
availability while collectively managing individual time to restrict total
availability behind the scenes.

%X Social media use is widespread, but many people worry about overuse. This
paper explores how and why people take breaks from social media. Using a mixed
methods approach, we pair data from users who tweeted about giving up Twitter
for Lent with an interview study of social media users. We find that 64% of
users who proclaim that they are giving up Twitter for Lent successfully do so.
Among those who fail, 31% acknowledge their failure; the other 69% simply
return. We observe hedging patterns (e.g. "I thought about giving up Twitter
for Lent but"?) that surfaced uncertainty about social media behavior.
Interview participants were concerned about the tradeoffs of spending time on
social media versus doing other things and of spending time on social media
rather than in "real life." We discuss gaps in related theory that might help
reduce users' anxieties and open design problems related to designing systems
and services that can help users manage their own social media use.

the overwhelming quantity has led to a poverty of attention. Existing manual

sacrifice efficiency, or fail to identify high value communications. In
response, we developed MinEMail, an alert system that uses a text message (SMS)

labeling and predicting which emails are critical, and when and how they need

%X The term email overload has two definitions: receiving a large volume of
incoming email, and having emails of different status types (to do, to read,
etc). Whittaker and Sidner proposed the latter definition in 1996, noticing
that email inboxes were far more complex than simply containing incoming
messages. Sixteen years after Whittaker and Sidner, we replicate and extend
their work with a qualitative analysis of Google's Gmail. We find that email
overload, both in terms of volume and of status, is still a problem today. Our
contributions are 1) updating the state of email overload, 2) extending our
understanding of overload in the context of Gmail and 3) comparing personal
with work email accounts: while work email tends to be status overloaded,
personal email is also type overloaded. These comparisons between work and
personal email suggest new avenues for email research.

smart-home devices using trigger-action ("if, then") programming. We find
trigger-action programming can express most desired behaviors submitted by
participants in an online study. We identify a class of triggers requiring
machine learning that has received little attention. We evaluate the uniqueness
of the 67,169 trigger-action programs shared on IFTTT.com, finding that real
users have written a large number of unique trigger-action interactions.
Finally, we conduct a 226-participant usability test of trigger-action

%X Future energy systems that rely on renewable energy may bring about a
radical shift in how we use energy in our homes. We developed and prototyped a
future scenario with highly variable, real-time electricity prices due to a
grid that mainly relies on renewables. We designed and deployed an agent-based
interactive system that enables users to effectively operate the washing
machine in this scenario. The system is used to book timeslots of washing
machine use so that the agent can help to minimize the cost of a wash by
charging a battery at times when electricity is cheap. We carried out a
deployment in 10 households in order to uncover the socio-technical challenges
around integrating new technologies into everyday routines. The findings reveal
tensions that arise when deploying a rationalistic system to manage
contingently and socially organized domestic practices. We discuss the
trade-offs between utility and convenience inherent in smart grid applications;
and illustrate how certain design choices position applications along this
spectrum.

%X The smart home is here. One area where smart home devices promise to deliver
great benefits is in the control of home heating, ventilation, and cooling
(HVAC) systems. In this paper, we seek to inform the design of future heating
and cooling systems by investigating users' experiences with the Nest Learning
Thermostat, a commercially available smart home device. We conducted a
qualitative study where we compared people's interactions with conventional
thermostats with interactions with the Nest. A key finding was that the Nest
impacted users' pattern of HVAC control, but only for a while, and caused new
problems in unrealized energy savings. In leveraging these findings, we create
a set of design implications for Eco-Interaction, the design of features and
human-system interactions with the goal of saving energy.

multiple languages. The network is heavily structured by language with most
mentions and retweets directed to users writing in the same language. Users
writing in multiple languages are more active, authoring more tweets than
monolingual users. These multilingual users play an important bridging role in
the global connectivity of the network. The mean level of insularity from
speakers in each language does not correlate straightforwardly with the size of
the user base as predicted by previous research. Finally, the English language
does play more of a bridging role than other languages, but the role played
collectively by multilingual users across different languages is the largest
bridging force in the network.

%X Real-time transcripts generated by automated speech recognition (ASR)
technologies have the potential to facilitate communication between native
speakers (NS) and non-native speakers (NNS). Previous studies of ASR have
focused on how transcripts aid NNS speech comprehension. In this study, we
examine whether transcripts benefit multiparty real-time conversation between
NS and NNS. We hypothesized that ASR transcripts would be more beneficial when
the transcripts were publicly shared by all group members as opposed to when
they were seen only by the NNS. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a lab
experiment in which 14 groups of native and non-native speakers engaged in a
story-telling task. Half of the groups received private transcripts that were
available only to the NNS; the other half received publicly shared transcripts
that were available to all group members. NS spoke more clearly, and both NS
and NNS rated the quality of communication higher, when transcripts were
publicly shared. These findings inform the design of future tools to support
multilingual group communication.

standard subtitles are geared more towards comprehension than vocabulary
learning, as translations are nonliteral and are provided only for phrases, not
vocabulary. This paper presents Smart Subtitles, which are interactive
subtitles tailored towards vocabulary learning. Smart Subtitles can be
automatically generated from common video sources such as subtitled DVDs. They
provide features such as vocabulary definitions on hover, and dialog-based
video navigation. In our pilot study with intermediate learners studying
Chinese, participants correctly defined over twice as many new words in a
post-viewing vocabulary test when they used Smart Subtitles, compared to dual
Chinese-English subtitles. Learners spent the same amount of time watching
clips with each tool, and enjoyed viewing videos with Smart Subtitles as much
as with dual subtitles. Learners understood videos equally well using either
tool, as indicated by self-assessments and independent evaluations of their
summaries.

one has studied the activity of annotating dynamic texts, such as online chat,

a standard chat tool for multilingual groups doing a brainstorming and
decision-making task. Results show that group satisfaction and perceived
control of the conversation are enhanced for the participants who used IA. We
also report new patterns of annotation use and discuss design implications for

the data sets tend to be complex and because the tasks associated with them are
often cognitively demanding. We introduce the Matrix Cube, a novel visual
representation and navigation model for dynamic networks, inspired by the way
people comprehend and manipulate physical cubes. Users can change their
perspective on the data by rotating or decomposing the 3D cube. These
manipulations can produce a range of different 2D visualizations that emphasize
specific aspects of the dynamic network suited to particular analysis tasks. We
describe Matrix Cubes and the interactions that can be performed on them in the
Cubix system. We then show how two domain experts, an astronomer and a
neurologist, used Cubix to explore and report on their own network data.

%X This article introduces A Table!, an enhanced soccer ranking table providing
temporal navigation by combining two novel interaction techniques. Ranking
tables order soccer teams represented as rows, according to values of columns
containing attributes e.g., accumulated points, or number of scored goals.
Because they represent a snapshot of a championship at a time t, tables are
regularly updated with new results. Such updates usually change the rows order,
which makes the tracking of a specified team over time difficult. We observed
that the tables available on the web do not support tracking such changes very
well, are generally hard to read, and lack interactions. This contrasts with
the extensive use of comments on temporal trends found in soccer analysts
articles. To better support such analyzes, the two interactive techniques
presented allow exploration of time, and are designed to preserve users' flow:
DRAG-CELL is based on direct manipulation of values to browse ranks; VIZ-RANK
uses a transient line chart of team ranks to visually explore a championship.
An on-line evaluation with 143 participants shows that each technique
efficiently supports a set of important temporal tasks not supported by current
ranking tables. This paves the way for introducing efficient advanced visual
exploration techniques to millions of soccer enthusiasts who use tables
everyday.

novel data visualization techniques that leverage new interaction methods and

easy to intuit, constraints that are easy to apply and visualize, and a
consistent view as data is manipulated in order to promote data exploration and
interrogation. We provide a framework for exploring this problem space, and an
example proof of concept system called Kinetica. We describe the results of a
user study that suggest users of Kinetica were able to explore multiple
dimensions of data at once, identify outliers, and discover trends with minimal

%X Most geographic maps visually represent physical distance; however, travel
time can in some cases be more important than distance because it directly
indicates availability. The technique of creating maps from temporal data is
known as isochronal cartography, and is a form of distortion for clarification.
In an isochronal map, congestion expands areas, while ideal travel conditions
make the map shrink in comparison to the actual distance scale of a traditional
map. Although there have been many applications of this technique, detailed
user studies of its efficacy remain scarce, and there are conflicting views on
its practical value. To attempt to settle this issue, we utilized a
user-centered design process to determine which features of isochronal
cartography might be most usable in practice. We developed an interactive
cartographic visualization system, Traffigram, that features a novel
combination of efficient isochronal map algorithms and an interface designed to
give map users a quick and seamless experience while preserving geospatial
integrity and aesthetics. We validated our design choices with multiple
usability studies. We present our results and discuss implications for design.

%X Games that use procedural content generation (PCG) do so in a wide variety
of ways and for different reasons. One of the most common reasons cited by PCG
system creators and game designers is improving replayability by providing a
means for automatically creating near-infinite amounts of content, the player
can come back and replay the game and refine her strategies over a long period.
However, this notion of replayability is both overly broad and incomplete as a
motivation. This paper contributes an analytical framework and associated
common vocabulary for understanding the role of PCG in games from a design
standpoint, with an aim of unpacking some of the broad justifications for PCG
use in games, and bringing together technical concerns in designing PCG systems
with design concerns related to creating engaging playable experiences.

%X Enjoyment has been identified as a central component of the player
experience (PX), but various, overlapping concepts within PX make it difficult
to develop valid measures and a common understanding of game enjoyment. We
conducted a systematic review of 87 quantitative studies, analyzing different
operationalizations and measures of game enjoyment, its determinants, and how
these were related to other components of PX, such as flow, presence and
immersion. Results suggest that game enjoyment describes the positive cognitive
and affective appraisal of the game experience, and may in part be associated
with the support of player needs and values. Further, we outline that enjoyment
is distinct from flow in that it may occur independently of challenge and
cognitive involvement, and argue that enjoyment may be understood as the
valence of the player experience. We conclude with a discussion of
methodological challenges and point out opportunities for future research on
game enjoyment.

%X Aim-assistance techniques have been shown to work for player balancing in 2D
environments, but little information exists about how well these techniques
will work in a 3D FPS game. We carried out three studies of the performance of
five different aim assists in an Unreal-based game world. The assists worked
well in a target-range scenario (study 1), but their performance was reduced
when game elements were introduced in a walkthrough map (study 2). We
systematically examined the relationships between realistic game elements and
assist performance (study 3). These studies show that two techniques -- bullet
magnetism and area cursor -- worked well in a wide variety of situations. Other
techniques that worked well were too perceptible, and some
previously-successful techniques did not work well in any game-like scenario.
Our studies are the first to provide empirical evidence of the performance of
aim assist techniques in 3D environments, and the first to identify the
complexities in using these techniques in real FPS games.

%X Motion gestures enable natural and intuitive input in video games. However,
game gestures designed by developers may not always be the optimal gestures for
players. A key challenge in designing appropriate game gestures lies in the
interaction-intensive nature of video games, i.e., several actions/commands may
need to be executed concurrently using different body parts. This study
analyzes user preferences in game gestures, with the aim of accommodating high
interactivity during gameplay. Two user-elicitation studies were conducted:
first, to determine user preferences, participants were asked to define
gestures for common game actions/commands; second, to develop effective
combined-gestures, participants were asked to define possible game gestures
using each body part (one and two hands, one and two legs, head, eyes, and
torso). Our study presents a set of suitable and alternative body parts for
common game actions/commands. We also present some simultaneously applied game
gestures that assist interaction in highly interactive game situations (e.g.,
selecting a weapon with the feet while shooting with the hand). Interesting
design implications are further discussed, e.g., transferability between hand
and leg gestures.

%X There is much recent work on using the digital footprints left by people on
social media to predict personal traits and gain a deeper understanding of
individuals. Due to the veracity of social media, imperfections in prediction
algorithms, and the sensitive nature of one's personal traits, much research is
still needed to better understand the effectiveness of this line of work,
including users' preferences of sharing their computationally derived traits.
In this paper, we report a two-part study involving 256 participants, which (1)
examines the feasibility and effectiveness of automatically deriving three
types of personality traits from Twitter, including Big 5 personality, basic
human values, and fundamental needs, and (2) investigates users' opinions of
using and sharing these traits. Our findings show there is a potential
feasibility of automatically deriving one's personality traits from social
media with various factors impacting the accuracy of models. The results also
indicate over 61.5% users are willing to share their derived traits in the
workplace and that a number of factors significantly influence their sharing
preferences. Since our findings demonstrate the feasibility of automatically
inferring a user's personal traits from social media, we discuss their
implications for designing a new generation of privacy-preserving,
hyper-personalized systems.

%X Photos are becoming prominent means of communication online. Despite photos'
pervasive presence in social media and online world, we know little about how
people interact and engage with their content. Understanding how photo content
might signify engagement, can impact both science and design, influencing
production and distribution. One common type of photo content that is shared on
social media, is the photos of people. From studies of offline behavior, we
know that human faces are powerful channels of non-verbal communication. In
this paper, we study this behavioral phenomena online. We ask how presence of a
face, it's age and gender might impact social engagement on the photo. We use a
corpus of 1 million Instagram images and organize our study around two social
engagement feedback factors, likes and comments. Our results show that photos
with faces are 38% more likely to receive likes and 32% more likely to receive
comments, even after controlling for social network reach and activity. We
find, however, that the number of faces, their age and gender do not have an
effect. This work presents the first results on how photos with human faces
relate to engagement on large scale image sharing communities. In addition to
contributing to the research around online user behavior, our findings offer a
new line of future work using visual analysis.

to be very subjective. Nevertheless, when consensus was reached, the video with
preferred content almost always achieved greater popularity on YouTube,
highlighting the importance of content in driving information popularity on
social media.

%X This paper presents an experiment on the relationship between personal
values and reading interests of online articles. Results suggest that
individuals' values can predict their topical interests. For example, holding
stronger universalism values predict interests towards environmental articles,
whereas holding stronger achievement values predict interest towards
work-related articles. Findings demonstrate the possibility of targeting based
on individuals' personal values, but also highlight certain challenges and
limitations when applying this approach for online content.

%X In this paper, we report on autoethnography as a method to access
non-routine usage of mobile devices, such as during business trips, vacations,
etc. Autoethnography, a self-study method with the researcher as participant,
was employed for the evaluation of a wrist blood pressure monitor used by
people with conditions such as hypertension. The findings from the study were
surprising, especially with respect to the environmental and social impact on
the use of the technology. Although the autoethnographic method can be
disruptive for the researcher, it enables them to understand and empathize with
the experiences mobile device users can face in difficult to access contexts.
This method allows HCI researchers to better understand user experiences with
mobile devices, including mobile medical technology, especially during
non-routine times that can be difficult to study in-situ with traditional user
studies.

%X While single-accelerometers are a common consumer embedded sensors, their
use in representing movement data as an intelligent resource remains scarce.
Accelerometers have been used in movement recognition systems, but rarely to
assess expressive qualities of movement. We present a prototype of wearable
system for the real-time detection and classification of movement quality using
acceleration data. The system applies Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) to
recognize Laban Effort qualities from acceleration input using a Machine
Learning software that generates classifications in real time. Existing
LMA-recognition systems rely on motion capture data and video data, and can
only be deployed in controlled settings. Our single-accelerometer system is
portable and can be used under a wide range of environmental conditions. We
evaluate the performance of the system, present two applications using the
system in the digital arts and discuss future directions.

%X With The Vocal Chorder, a large interactive instrument to create
accompaniment, opera singers can get more power over the performance. The
device allows performers to interactively accompany themselves through pushing,
leaning on and bending steel wires. The design was guided by the unique needs
of the solo-singer, explored through autobiographical design and material
explorations, some on stage, and later tested by other singers. We discuss how
designing for opera and for the stage requires extraordinary durability and how
opera performances can change with a bodily-oriented instrument such as The
Vocal Chorder. Through a designerly exploration, we arrived at a device that
offered (1) a tool for singers to take control over the rhythmical pace and
overall artistic and aesthetic outcome of their performances, (2) an enriched
sense of embodiment between their voice and the overall performance; and (3) a
means to empower opera singers on stage.

%X The entertainment industry is going through a transformation, and technology
development is affecting how we can enjoy and interact with the entertainment
media content in new ways. In our work, we explore how to enable interaction
with content in the context of 3D cinemas. This allows viewers to use their
mobile phone to retrieve, for example, information on the artist of the
soundtrack currently playing or a discount coupon on the watch the main actor
is wearing. We are particularly interested in the user experience of the
interactive 3D cinema concept, and how different interactive elements and
interaction techniques are perceived. We report on the development of a
prototype application utilizing smart phones and on an evaluation in a cinema
context with 20 participants. Results emphasize that designing for interactive
cinema experiences should drive for holistic and positive user experiences.
Interactive content should be tied together with the actual video content, but
integrated into contexts where it does not conflict with the immersive
experience with the movie.

%X Livecoding is an artistic programming practice in which an artist's
low-level interaction can be observed with sufficiently high fidelity to allow
for transcription and analysis. This paper presents the first reported "coding"
of livecoding videos. From an identified corpus of videos available on the web,
we coded performances of two different livecoding artists, recording both the
(textual) programming edit events and the musical effect of these edits. Our
analysis includes a novel, transition-matrix visualisation of the textual and
musical dimensions of this data to create a "performer fingerprint". We show
how detailed transcriptions of livecoding videos can be made which, we hope,
will provide a foundation for further research into describing and
understanding livecoding.

%X Percussionists are unique among western classical instrumentalists in that
their artistic practice is defined by an approach to interaction rather than
their instruments. While percussionists are accustomed to exploring
non-traditional objects to create music, these objects have yet to encompass
touch-screen computing devices to any great extent. The proliferation and
popularity of these devices now presents an opportunity to explore their use in
combining computer-generated sound together with percussive interaction in a
musical ensemble.
   This paper examines Ensemble Metatone, a group formed to explore the
"infiltration" of iPad-based musical instruments into a free-improvisation
percussion ensemble. We discuss the design approach for two different iPad
percussion instruments and the methodology for exploring them with the group
over a series of rehearsals and performances. Qualitative analysis of
discussions throughout this process shows that the musicians developed a
vocabulary of gestures and musical interactions to make musical sense of these
new instruments.

%X Mobile devices have limited battery life, and numerous battery management
applications are available that aim to improve it. This paper examines a
large-scale mobile battery awareness application, called Carat, to see how it
changes user behavior with long-term use. We conducted a survey of current
Carat Android users and analyzed their interaction logs. The results show that
long-term Carat users save more battery, charge their devices less often, learn
to manage their battery with less help from Carat, have a better understanding
of how Carat works, and may enjoy competing against other users. Based on these
findings, we propose a set of guidelines for mobile battery awareness
applications: battery awareness applications should make the reasoning behind
their recommendations understandable to the user, be tailored to retain
long-term users, take the audience into account when formulating feedback, and
distinguish third-party and system applications.

%X EnergyBugs are energy harvesting wearables with features that invite
children to move their bodies to generate tiny, yet usable amounts of
electricity. EnergyBugs not only convert children's kinetic energy into usable
electrical energy, but also let children power a specially designed LED lamp
with the energy the children have personally harvested. EnergyBugs therefore
turn the electrical energy into a tangible object that children can manipulate
and think with. Two studies of EnergyBugs with 34 elementary school children
have revealed that children carefully observed and negotiated the use of
personally harvested energy with their classmates, as well as developed
emotional connections to energy. In particular, moving their own bodies to
generate energy led the children to more actively ask questions about energy
from new perspectives. We report our iterative design process and discuss the
implications of our results for HCI.

%X We present the design, development and evaluation of a bi-directional
inductive power transfer circuit for prototyping purposes in the watt-range.
Our device does not require any configuration and is intended for the
development of wearable and tangible systems. Our approach allows a
bi-directional power flow without any change in the circuit, such that the same
circuit can be used for charging and discharging a battery. The contribution of
this work is an enabling technology for researchers and practitioners in the
fields of Wearable Electronics, Ubiquitous Computing and Human-Computer
Interaction interested in exploring new interactions powered by watt-range
inductive links. It enables smaller battery sizes, and therefore lighter
devices, as the power can be distributed in a way that has not been feasible
before. We discuss the motivations, technical details and the workshop
evaluating our inductive approach.

%X Low power "helper" cores have been increasingly included on application
processors to accomplish low intensity tasks such as music playing and motion
sensing with minimum energy consumption. Recently, Guimbreti&egrave;re et al.
[1] demonstrated that such helper cores can also be used to execute simple user
interface tasks. We revisit this approach by implementing a similar system on
an off-the-shelf application processor (TI OMAP4). Our study shows that in the
case of high event rate interactions (pen inking and virtual keyboard),
significant battery life gains (&times;1.7 and &times;2.3 respectively) can be
achieved with the helper core executing the interface. Having the helper core
only dis-patch input events incurs a 18% penalty relative to the maximum
savings rate, but allows for simplified deployment since it merely requires a
change in toolkit infrastructure.

%X Mid-air interactions are prone to fatigue and lead to a feeling of heaviness
in the upper limbs, a condition casually termed as the gorilla-arm effect.
Designers have often associated limitations of their mid-air interactions with
arm fatigue, but do not possess a quantitative method to assess and therefore
mitigate it. In this paper we propose a novel metric, Consumed Endurance (CE),
derived from the biomechanical structure of the upper arm and aimed at
characterizing the gorilla-arm effect. We present a method to capture CE in a
non-intrusive manner using an off-the-shelf camera-based skeleton tracking
system, and demonstrate that CE correlates strongly with the Borg CR10 scale of
perceived exertion. We show how designers can use CE as a complementary metric
for evaluating existing and designing novel mid-air interactions, including
tasks with repetitive input such as mid-air text-entry. Finally, we propose a
series of guidelines for the design of fatigue-efficient mid-air interfaces.

%X Word-gesture keyboards enable fast text entry by letting users draw the
shape of a word on the input surface. Such keyboards have been used extensively
for touch devices, but not in mid-air, even though their fluent gestural input
seems well suited for this modality. We present Vulture, a word-gesture
keyboard for mid-air operation. Vulture adapts touch based word-gesture
algorithms to work in mid-air, projects users' movement onto the display, and
uses pinch as a word delimiter. A first 10-session study suggests text-entry
rates of 20.6 Words Per Minute (WPM) and finds hand-movement speed to be the
primary predictor of WPM. A second study shows that with training on a few
phrases, participants do 28.1 WPM, 59% of the text-entry rate of direct touch
input. Participants' recall of trained gestures in mid-air was low, suggesting
that visual feedback is important but also limits performance. Based on data
from the studies, we discuss improvements to Vulture and some alternative
designs for mid-air text entry.

%X Using the space above desktop input devices adds a rich new input channel to
desktop interaction. Input in this elevated layer has been previously used to
modify the granularity of a 2D slider, navigate layers of a 3D body scan above
a multitouch table and access vertically stacked menus. However, designing
these interactions is challenging because the lack of haptic and direct visual
feedback easily leads to input errors. For bare finger input, the user's
fingers needs to reliably enter and stay inside the interactive layer, and
engagement techniques such as midair clicking have to be disambiguated from
leaving the layer. These issues have been addressed for interactions in which
users operate other devices in midair, but there is little guidance for the
design of bare finger input in this space.
   In this paper, we present the results of two user studies that inform the
design of finger input above desktop devices. Our studies show that 2 cm is the
minimum thickness of the above-surface volume that users can reliably remain
within. We found that when accessing midair layers, users do not automatically
move to the same height. To address this, we introduce a technique that
dynamically determines the height at which the layer is placed, depending on
the velocity profile of the user's initial finger movement into midair.
Finally, we propose a technique that reliably distinguishes clicking from
homing movements, based on the user's hand shape. We structure the presentation
of our findings using Buxton's three-state input model, adding additional
states and transitions for above-surface interactions.

%X Counting using one's fingers is a potentially intuitive way to enumerate a
list of items and lends itself naturally to gesture-based menu systems. In this
paper, we present the results of the first comprehensive study on Finger-Count
menus to investigate its usefulness as a viable option for 3D menu selection
tasks. Our study compares 3D gesture-based finger counting (Finger Count menus)
with two gesture-based menu selection techniques (Hand-n-Hold, Thumbs-Up),
derived from existing motion-controlled video game menu selection strategies,
as well as 3D Marking menus. We examined selection time, selection accuracy and
user preference for all techniques. We also examined the impact of different
spatial layouts for menu items and different menu depths. Our results indicate
that Finger-Count menus are significantly faster than the other menu techniques
we tested and are the most liked by participants. Additionally, we found that
while Finger-Count menus and 3D Marking menus have similar selection accuracy,
Finger-Count menus are almost twice as fast compared to 3D Marking menus.

%X While pen computing has become increasingly more popular, device
responsiveness, or latency, still plagues such interaction. Although there have
been advances in digitizer technology over the last few years, commercial
end-to-end latencies are unfortunately similar to those found with
touchscreens, i.e., 65 -- 120 milliseconds. We report on a prototype
stylus-enabled device, the High Performance Stylus System (HPSS), designed to
display latencies as low as one millisecond while users ink or perform dragging
tasks.
   To understand the role of latency while inking with a stylus, psychophysical
just-noticeable difference experiments were conducted using the HPSS. While
participants performed dragging and scribbling tasks, very low levels of
latency could be discriminated, i.e., 1 versus 2 milliseconds while dragging
and 7 versus 40 milliseconds while scribbling. The HPSS and our experimentation
have provided further motivation for the implementation of latency saving
measures in pen-based hardware and software systems.

%X The multi-touch-based pinch to zoom, drag and flick to pan metaphor has
gained wide popularity on mobile displays, where it is the paradigm of choice
for navigating 2D documents. But is finger-based navigation really the gold
standard' In this paper, we present a comprehensive user study with 40
participants, in which we systematically compared the Pinch-Drag-Flick approach
with a technique that relies on spatial manipulation, such as lifting a display
up/down to zoom. While we solely considered known techniques, we put
considerable effort in implementing both input strategies on popular consumer
hardware (iPhone, iPad). Our results show that spatial manipulation can
significantly outperform traditional Pinch-Drag-Flick. Given the carefully
optimized prototypes, we are confident to have found strong arguments that
future generations of mobile devices could rely much more on spatial
interaction principles.

that allows users to easily create ink-based notes by finger drawing and

mechanisms to support the capture of informal notes and annotations. We

%X Ultrasonic haptic feedback is a promising means of providing tactile
sensations in mid-air without encumbering the user with an actuator. However,
controlled and rigorous HCI research is needed to understand the basic
characteristics of perception of this new feedback medium, and so how best to
utilise ultrasonic haptics in an interface. This paper describes two
experiments conducted into two fundamental aspects of ultrasonic haptic
perception: 1) localisation of a static point and 2) the perception of motion.
Understanding these would provide insight into 1) the spatial resolution of an
ultrasonic interface and 2) what forms of feedback give the most convincing
illusion of movement. Results show an average localisation error of 8.5mm, with
higher error along the longitudinal axis. Convincing sensations of motion were
produced when travelling longer distances, using longer stimulus durations and
stimulating multiple points along the trajectory. Guidelines for feedback
design are given.

conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 52 video recordings of
Quantified Self Meetup talks to understand what they did, how they did it, and
what they learned. We highlight several common pitfalls to self-tracking,
including tracking too many things, not tracking triggers and context, and
insufficient scientific rigor. We identify future research efforts that could

findings can have broad implications in designing and developing self-tracking

%X Thousands of people use the Internet to discuss pain symptoms. While
communication between patients and physicians involves both verbal and physical
interactions, online discussions of symptoms typically comprise text only. We
present BodyDiagrams, an online interface for expressing symptoms via drawings
and text. BodyDiagrams augment textual descriptions with pain diagrams drawn
over a reference body and annotated with severity and temporal metadata. The
resulting diagrams can easily be shared to solicit feedback and advice. We also
conduct a two-phase user study to assess BodyDiagrams' communicative efficacy.
In the first phase, users describe pain symptoms using BodyDiagrams and a

%X This paper characterises the use of activity trackers as "lived
informatics". This characterisation is contrasted with other discussions of
personal informatics and the quantified self. The paper reports an interview
study with activity tracker users. The study found: people do not logically
organise, but interweave various activity trackers, sometimes with ostensibly
the same functionality; that tracking is often social and collaborative rather
than personal; that there are different styles of tracking, including goal
driven tracking and documentary tracking; and that tracking information is
often used and interpreted with reference to daily or short term goals and
decision making. We suggest there will be difficulties in personal informatics
if we ignore the way that personal tracking is enmeshed with everyday life and
people's outlook on their future.

%X To date, research in sustainable HCI has dealt with eco-feedback, usage and
recycling of appliances within the home, and longevity of portable electronics
such as mobile phones. However, there seems to be less awareness of the energy
and greenhouse emissions impacts of domestic consumer electronics and
information technology. Such awareness is needed to inform HCI sustainability
researchers on how best to prioritise efforts around digital media and IT.
Grounded in inventories, interview and plug energy data from 33 undergraduate
student participants, our findings provide the context for assessing approaches
to reducing the energy and carbon emissions of media and IT in the home. In the
paper, we use the findings to discuss and inform more fruitful directions that
sustainable HCI research might take, and we quantify how various strategies
might have modified the energy and emissions impacts for our participants.

%X This paper explores an emerging paradigm for HCI design research based
primarily upon engagement, reciprocity and doing. Much HCI research begins with
an investigatory and analytic ethnographic approach before translating to
design. Design may come much later in the process and may never benefit the
community that is researched. However in many settings it is difficult for
researchers to access the privileged ethnographer position of observer and
investigator. Moreover rapid ethnographic research often does not seem the best
or most appropriate course of action. We draw upon a project working with a
remote Australian Aboriginal community to illustrate an alternative approach in
Indigenous research, where the notion of reciprocity is first and foremost. We
argue that this can lead to sustainable designs, valid research and profound
innovation.

%X We present an investigation of two different visualizations of video
history: Video Timeline and Video Tiles. Video Timeline extends the commonly
employed list-based visualization for navigation history by applying size to
indicate heuristics and occupying the full screen with a two-sided timeline.
Video Tiles visualizes history items in a grid-based layout by following
pre-defined templates based on items' heuristics and ordering, utilizing screen
space more effectively at the expense of a clearer temporal location. The
visualizations are compared against the state-of-the-art method (a
filmstrip-based visualization), with ten participants tasked with sharing their
previously-seen affective intervals. Our study shows that our visualizations
are perceived as intuitive and both outperform and are strongly preferred to
the current method. Based on these results, Video Timeline and Video Tiles
provide an effective addition to video viewers to help manage the growing
quantity of video. They provide users with insight into their navigation
patterns, allowing them to quickly find previously-seen intervals, leading to
efficient clip sharing, simpler authoring and video summarization.

communication system designed to support creative play in customized
environments. Users can interact together in virtual environments composed of
digital assets layered in 3D space. The goal of the project is to support
creative play and increase social engagement during video sessions of
geographically separated families. We try to understand the value of
customization for individual families with children ages 6-12. We present
interviews with creativity experts, a pilot study and a formal evaluation of
families playing together in four conditions: separate windows, merged windows,
digital play sets, and customized digital environments. We found that playing
in the same video space enables new activities and increases social engagement
for families. Customization allows families to modify scenes for their needs
and support more creative play activities that embody the imagination of the
child.

%X Video authoring activity typically consists of three phases: planning
(pre-production), capture (production) and processing (post-production). The
status quo is that these phases occur separately, and the latter two have a
significant amount of "slack time", where the camera operator is watching the
scene unfold during capture, and the editor is re-watching and navigating
through recorded footage during post-production. While this process is well
suited to creating polished or professional video, video clips produced by
casual video makers as seen in online forums could benefit from some editing
without the overhead of current authoring tools. We introduce LACES, a
tablet-based system enabling simple video manipulations in the midst of
filming. Seamless in-situ integration of video capture and manipulation forms a
novel workflow, allowing greater spontaneity and exploration of video creation.

%X During online search, the user's expectations often differ from those of the
author. This is known as the "intention gap" and is particularly problematic
when searching for and discriminating between online video content. An author
uses description and meta-data tags to label their content, but often cannot
predict alternate interpretations or appropriations of their work. To address
this intention gap, we present ThumbReels, a concept for query-sensitive video
previews generated from crowdsourced, temporally defined semantic tagging.
Further, we supply an open-source tool that supports on-the-fly temporal
tagging of videos, whose output can be used for later search queries. A first
user study validates the tool and concept. We then present a second study that
shows participants found ThumbReels to better represent search terms than
contemporary preview techniques.

effective process of innovation. This process of analogy searching is difficult
for both humans and machines. In this paper, we present a novel approach for
re-presenting a problem in terms of its abstract structure, and then allowing
people to use this structural representation to find analogies. We propose a
crowdsourcing process that helps people navigate a large dataset to find
analogies. Through two experiments, we show the benefits of using abstract
structural representations to search for ideas that are analogous to a source
problem, and that these analogies result in better solutions than alternative
approaches. This work provides a useful method for finding analogies, and can
streamline innovation for both novices and professional designers.

%X Harnessing crowds can be a powerful mechanism for increasing innovation.
However, current approaches to crowd innovation rely on large numbers of
contributors generating ideas independently in an unstructured way. We
introduce a new approach called distributed analogical idea generation, which
aims to make idea generation more effective and less reliant on chance. Drawing
from the literature in cognitive science on analogy and schema induction, our
approach decomposes the creative process in a structured way amenable to using
crowds. In three experiments we show that distributed analogical idea
generation leads to better ideas than example-based approaches, and investigate
the conditions under which crowds generate good schemas and ideas. Our results
have implications for improving creativity and building systems for distributed
crowd innovation.

%X Organizing conference sessions around themes improves the experience for
attendees. However, the session creation process can be difficult and
time-consuming due to the amount of expertise and effort required to consider
alternative paper groupings. We present a collaborative web application called
Frenzy to draw on the efforts and knowledge of an entire program committee.
Frenzy comprises (a) interfaces to support large numbers of experts working
collectively to create sessions, and (b) a two-stage process that decomposes
the session-creation problem into meta-data elicitation and global constraint
satisfaction. Meta-data elicitation involves a large group of experts working
simultaneously, while global constraint satisfaction involves a smaller group
that uses the meta-data to form sessions.
   We evaluated Frenzy with 48 people during a deployment at the CSCW 2014
program committee meeting. The session making process was much faster than the
traditional process, taking 88 minutes instead of a full day. We found that
meta-data elicitation was useful for session creation. Moreover, the sessions
created by Frenzy were the basis of the CSCW 2014 schedule.

%X Search engines typically return so many results that choosing from the list
might be predicted to suffer from the effects of "choice overload". Preliminary
work has reported just such an effect [12]. In this paper a series of three
experiments was conducted to investigate the choice overload effect in search
engine use. Participants were given search tasks and presented with either six
or twenty-four returns to choose from. The results revealed that the choice
behaviour was strongly influenced by the ranking of returns, and that choice
satisfaction was affected by the number of options and the decision time. The
main results, from the third experiment, showed that large sets of options
yielded a positive effect on participants' satisfaction when they made a
decision without time limit. When time was more strongly constrained, choices
from small sets led to relatively higher satisfaction. Our studies show how
user satisfaction with found information can be affected by processing
strategies that are influenced by search engine design features.

%X HCI is increasingly interested in amateurism, but the wider literature
suggests that the amateur is a complex and distinctive phenomenon. An interview
study reveals the nature of the amateur in the digital age. Even though
operating non-professionally at a micro-scale, amateur musicians employ a
plethora of online services to sustain local fanbases, reach out to new fans,
collaborate internationally, and actively promote both digital and material
products. Our findings lead to recommendations for event-oriented promotion
tools; community-oriented analytics; tangible and embedded products; and
limited-edition digital experiences. We conclude that HCI needs to recognise
the amateur as an important class of user, one who is serious about their
leisure, and who is also distinct from the professional as from the novice and
hobbyist.

%X Interactive mobile technologies have become part of audience experiences of
live performances in terms of both general media sharing and specific
(sometimes official) extra content. At the same time, high bandwidth affords
streaming of live events to mobile devices. We take advantage of these
technologies in our high resolution, panoramic image video stream and study a
scenario of audience members viewing the very same live event they are watching
on a tablet. The video stream on the tablet is navigational and enables
audience members to pan and zoom in the real-time video feed. We studied
audience interaction and impressions in three performances of a dance and music
show and found distinct uses of the second screen video stream. We emphasize
that despite initial reluctance, the observed utilization of the technology
opened up for new potential practices. Our study shows how working with
perceived conflict in technology can still open up design space for interactive
technologies.

%X Previously, video streaming sites were at the fringes of online social
media. In the past two years, live streams of video games, on sites such as
Twitch.tv, have become very popular. Live streams serve as meeting grounds for
player communities. The Twitch streaming medium combines broadcast video with
open IRC chat channels. In conjunction with gameplay, viewer participation and
community building gain emphasis. Twitch streams range in size and nature, from
intimate communities with fifty viewers, to massive broadcasts with tens of
thousands. In this paper, we present an ethnographic investigation of the live
streaming of video games on Twitch.
   We find that Twitch streams act as virtual third places, in which informal
communities emerge, socialize, and participate. Over time, stream communities
form around shared identities drawn from streams? contents and participants?
shared experiences. We describe processes through which stream communities
form, the motivations of members, and emergent issues in the medium. Finally,
we draw from our findings to derive implications for design of live mixed-media
environments to support participatory online communities.

%X Pro-Am live video producers broadcast events on a regular basis. They are
here selected for an ethnographic study since their continuous content
generation can teach us something of what it takes for amateurs, who currently
struggle with mastering the video medium, to become proficient producers. We
learn from media theory that Pro-Ams are distinguished from professionals in
terms of inherent skills and identities, and have therefore focused on these
characteristics. We add to this research by showing on-going challenges that
the former face in their production, i.e. how their learning practices, such as
learning through instructions, are situated and related to particular settings.
Learning and development of skills were done as organizations, rather than as
individuals. Furthermore, the recurrent nature of both events and broadcasts
appears to be an important condition for establishing the terms needed to carry
out a production, and to learn the skills of a producer. This understanding may
explain in part why accounts in previous research, of single users struggling
with the affordances of live video, point to such difficulties in mastering the
medium. The findings guide design to better support activities contiguous with
the set-up of the production, rather than the broadcast per se.

%X Understanding the relationships among environment, behavior, and health is a
core concern of public health researchers. While a number of recent studies
have investigated the use of social media to track infectious diseases such as
influenza, little work has been done to determine if other health concerns can
be inferred. In this paper, we present a large-scale study of 27 health-related
statistics, including obesity, health insurance coverage, access to healthy
foods, and teen birth rates. We perform a linguistic analysis of the Twitter
activity in the top 100 most populous counties in the U.S., and find a
significant correlation with 6 of the 27 health statistics. When compared to
traditional models based on demographic variables alone, we find that
augmenting models with Twitter-derived information improves predictive accuracy
for 20 of 27 statistics, suggesting that this new methodology can complement
existing approaches.

impacting abstinence and relapse during cessation attempts. Combining automatic
and crowdsourced techniques, we detect users trying to quit smoking and analyze
tweet and network data from a sample of 653 individuals over a two-year window
of quitting. Guided by theory and practice, we derive behavioral, social, and
emotional measures to compare users who abstain and relapse. We also examine
the cessation process, demonstrating that Twitter can help chronicle how some
people go about quitting. Among other results, we show that those who fail in
their smoking cessation are far heavier posters and use relatively less
positive language, while those who succeed are more social in both network ties
and in directed communication. We conclude with insights on how intelligent
intervention systems can harness these signals to provide tailored behavior
change support.

face-to-face support groups, health professionals facilitate peer-patients
exchanging experience while adding their clinical expertise when necessary.
However, the large scale of online health communities makes it challenging for
such health professional moderators' involvement to happen. To address this
challenge of delivering clinical expertise to where patients need them, we
explore the idea of semi-automatically providing clinical expertise in online
health communities. We interviewed 14 clinicians showing them example
peer-patient conversation threads. From the interviews, we examined the ideal
practice of clinicians providing expertise to patients. The clinicians
continuously assessed when peer-patients were providing appropriate support,
what kinds of clinical help they could give online, and when to defer to
patients' healthcare providers. The findings inform requirements for building a
semi-automated system delivering clinical expertise in online health

%X Search engines and social media are two of the most commonly used online
services; in this paper, we examine how users appropriate these platforms for
online health activities via both large-scale log analysis and a survey of 210
people. While users often turn to search engines to learn about serious or
highly stigmatic conditions, a surprising amount of sensitive health
information is also sought and shared via social media, in our case the public
social platform Twitter. We contrast what health content people seek via search
engines vs. share on social media, as well as why they choose a particular
platform for online health activities. We reflect on the implications of our
results for designing search engines, social media, and social search tools
that better support people's health information seeking and sharing needs.

%X We present RetroDepth, a new vision-based system for accurately sensing the
3D silhouettes of hands, styluses, and other objects, as they interact on and
above physical surfaces. Our setup is simple, cheap, and easily reproducible,
comprising of two infrared cameras, diffuse infrared LEDs, and any
off-the-shelf retro-reflective material. The retro-reflector aids image
segmentation, creating a strong contrast between the surface and any object in
proximity. A new highly efficient stereo matching algorithm precisely estimates
the 3D contours of interacting objects and the retro-reflective surfaces. A
novel pipeline enables 3D finger, hand and object tracking, as well as gesture
recognition, purely using these 3D contours. We demonstrate high-precision
sensing, allowing robust disambiguation between a finger or stylus touching,
pressing or interacting above the surface. This allows many interactive
scenarios that seamlessly mix together freehand 3D interactions with touch,
pressure and stylus input. As shown, these rich modalities of input are enabled
on and above any retro-reflective surface, including custom "physical widgets"
fabricated by users. We compare our system with Kinect and Leap Motion, and
conclude with limitations and future work.

gestures to control association and information transfer among a set of devices
that are placed on a mutually shared surface (e.g., a table). SurfaceLink uses
a combination of on-device accelerometers, vibration motors, speakers and
microphones (and, optionally, an off-device contact microphone for greater
sensitivity) to sense gestures performed on the shared surface. In a controlled
evaluation with 10 participants, SurfaceLink detected the presence of devices
on the same surface with 97.7% accuracy, their relative arrangement with 89.4%
accuracy, and various single- and multi-touch surface gestures with an average
accuracy of 90.3%. A usability analysis showed that SurfaceLink has advantages
over current multi-device interaction techniques in a number of situations.

%X We report on two experiments that investigate the influence of display type
and viewing angle on how people place their trust during avatar-mediated
interaction. By monitoring advice seeking behavior, our first experiment
demonstrates that if participants observe an avatar at an oblique viewing angle
on a flat display, they are less able to discriminate between expert and
non-expert advice than if they observe the avatar face-on. We then introduce a
novel spherical display and a ray-traced rendering technique that can display
an avatar that can be seen correctly from any viewing direction. We expect that
a spherical display has advantages over a flat display because it better
supports non-verbal cues, particularly gaze direction, since it presents a
clear and undistorted viewing aspect at all angles. Our second experiment
compares the spherical display to a flat display. Whilst participants can
discriminate expert advice regardless of display, a negative bias towards the
flat screen emerges at oblique viewing angles. This result emphasizes the
ability of the spherical display to be viewed qualitatively similarly from all
angles. Together the experiments demonstrate how trust can be altered depending
on how one views the avatar.

multiplexing of signals coming from a universal interdigitated electrode
design, which is printed as a single conductive layer on a flexible substrate.
It supports sensing of touch and proximity input, and moreover is capable of
capturing several levels of pressure and flexing. We leverage recent
developments in conductive inkjet printing as a way to prototype electrode
patterns, and combine this with our hardware module for supporting the full
range of sensing methods. As the technique is low-cost and easy to implement,
it is particularly well-suited for prototyping touch- and hover-based user
interfaces, including curved and deformable ones.

%X Large-scale touch surfaces have been widely studied in literature and
adopted for public installations such as interactive billboards. However,
current designs do not take into consideration that touching the interactive
surface at different heights is not the same; for body-height displays, the
bottom portion of the screen is within easier reach of the foot than the hand.
We explore the design space of foot input on vertical surfaces, and propose
three distinct interaction modalities: hand, foot tapping, and foot gesturing.
Our design exploration pays particular attention to areas of the touch surface
that were previously overlooked: out of hand's reach and close to the floor. We
instantiate our design space with a working prototype of an interactive
surface, in which we are able to distinguish between finger and foot tapping
and extend the input area beyond the bottom of the display to support foot
gestures.

%X We present Communiplay, a public display media space. People passing by see
their own contour mirrored on a public display and can start to play with
virtual objects. At the same time, they see others playing at remote displays
within the same virtual space. We are interested whether people would use such
a public display media space, and if so, how and why. We evaluate Communiplay
in a field study in six connected locations and find a remote honey-pot effect,
i.e. people interacting at one location attract people at other locations. The
conversion rate (percentage of passers-by starting to interact) rose by +136%
when people saw others playing at remote locations. We also provide the first
quantification of the (local) honey-pot effect (in our case it raised the
conversion rate by +604% when people saw others playing at the same location).
We conclude that the integration of multiple public displays into a media space
is a promising direction for public displays and can make them more attractive
and valuable.

%X The next decade is likely to see a shift in digital public displays moving
from non-interactive to interactive content. This will likely create a need for
digital bulletin boards and for a better understanding of how such displays
should be designed to encourage community members to interact with them. Our
study addresses this by exploring community bulletin boards as a ubiquitous
type of participatory non-digital display "in the wild". Our results highlight
how they are used for content of local and contextual relevance, and how
cultures of participation, personalization, location, the tangible character of
architecture, access, control and flexibility might affect community members'
level of engagement with them. Our analysis suggests entry points as design
considerations intrinsically linked to the users' sense of agency within a
delineated space. Overlaps with related work are identified throughout to
provide further validation of previous findings in this area of research.

%X Public displays have advanced from isolated and non interactive "ad"
displays which show images and videos to displays that are networked,
interactive, and open to a wide variety of content and applications. Prior work
has shown large potential of user-generated content on public displays.
However, one of the problems with user-generated content on public displays is
moderation as content may be explicit or troublesome for a particular location.
In this work we explore the expectations of users with regard to content
moderation on public displays. An online survey revealed that people not only
think that display content should be moderated but also that a delay of up to
10 minutes is acceptable if display content is moderated. In a subsequent in
the wild deployment we compared different moderation delays. We found that a
moderation delay significantly decreases the number of user-generated posts
while at the same time there is no significant effect on users' decision to
repeatedly post on the display.

%X Robotic products are envisioned to offer rich interactions in a range of
environments. While their specific roles will vary across applications, these
products will draw on fundamental building blocks of interaction, such as
greeting people, narrating information, providing instructions, and asking and
answering questions. In this paper, we explore how such building blocks might
serve as interaction design patterns that enable design exploration and
prototyping for human-robot interaction. To construct a pattern library, we
observed human interactions across different scenarios and identified seven
patterns, such as question-answer pairs. We then designed and implemented
Interaction Blocks, a visual authoring environment that enabled prototyping of
robot interactions using these patterns. Design sessions with designers and
developers demonstrated the promise of using a pattern language for designing
robot interactions, confirmed the usability of our authoring environment, and
provided insights into future research on tools for human-robot interaction
design.

%X Humans have a tendency to consider media devices as social beings. Social
agents and artificial opponents can be examined as one instance of this effect.
With today's technology it is already possible to create artificial agents that
are perceived as socially present. In this paper, we start by identifying the
factors that influence perceptions of social presence in human-agent
interactions. By taking these factors into account and by following previously
defined guidelines for building socially present artificial opponents, a case
study was created in which a social robot plays the Risk board game against
three human players. An experiment was performed to ascertain whether the agent
created in this case study is perceived as socially present. The experiment
suggested that by following the guidelines for creating socially present
artificial board game opponents, the perceived social presence of users towards
the artificial agent improves.

%X Gestures are important non-verbal signals in human communication. Research
with virtual agents and robots has started to add to the scientific knowledge
about gestures but many questions with respect to the use of gestures in
human-computer interaction are still open. This paper investigates the
influence of robot gestures on the users' perceived workload and task
performance (i.e. information recall) in a direction-giving task. We conducted
a 2 x 2 (robot gestures vs. no robot gestures x easy vs. difficult task)
experiment. The results indicate that robot gestures increased user performance
and decreased perceived workload in the difficult task but not in the easy
task. Thus, robot gestures are a promising means to improve human-robot
interaction particularly in challenging tasks.

%X Many tasks call for efficient user interaction under time delay-controlling
space instruments, piloting remote aircraft and operating search and rescue
robots. In this paper we identify an underexplored design opportunity for
building robotic teleoperation user interfaces following an evaluation of
operator performance during a time-delayed robotic arm block-stacking task in
twenty-two participants. More delay resulted in greater operator hesitation and
a decreased ratio of active to inactive input. This ratio can serve as a useful
proxy for measuring an operator's ability to anticipate the outcome of their
control inputs before receiving delayed visual feedback. High anticipatory
input ratio (AIR) scores indicate times when robot operators enter commands
before waiting for visual feedback. Low AIR scores highlight when operators
must wait for visual feedback before continuing. We used this measurement to
help us identify particular sub-tasks where operators would likely benefit from
additional support.

%X In recent years, HCI researchers have increased their focus on studying the
power relationships between researchers and users, and developing methodologies
for eliciting design ideas that are sensitive to existing epistemic hierarchies
in technology design. The differential value given to expert versus lay
knowledge is a central factor in these debates. We apply Artifact Analysis,
developed to help designers handle the complexity of digital artifacts, as a
method to explore how experts and non-experts understand and frame robots, a
technology characterized by significant complexity. Our results show that both
non-expert users and expert researchers have knowledge that is significant to
future robot development, but they focus on different aspects of the technology
-- users address mediated and interaction complexity while researchers focus on
internal and external complexity. We also found that robots function as
boundary objects between experts and users, and suggest that one task designers
can perform is to "stay on the boundary" and mediate between the different ways
in which experts and non-experts frame emerging technology to develop designs
that benefit from insights from both user and researcher perspectives.

that facilitates ad-hoc communication between first responders and victims in
emergency situations. Our approach leverages established protocols and
standards in unforeseen ways to provide a platform supporting the creation of
short-lived communication links. The system comprises two mobile applications:
one victim application that allows the broadcasting of distress signals by a
novel use of Wi-Fi SSIDs; and a responder application that allows first
responders to discover and trace the people broadcasting the signals. The main
difference of our system with other platforms enabling communication in crisis
situations is that our system is independent from existing network
infrastructure and runs on off-the-shelf, commercially available smartphones.
We describe the results of our evaluation process in the context of both a
design evaluation during a real-world emergency response exercise and of two
user workshops in preparation for an upcoming large-scale exercise.

%X Social media and other online communication tools are a subject of great
interest in mass emergency response. Members of the public are turning to these
solutions to seek and offer emergency information. Emergency responders are
working to determine what social media policies should be in terms of their
"public information" functions. We report on the online communications from all
the coastal fire and police departments within a 100 mile radius of Hurricane
Sandy's US landfall. Across four types of online communication media, we
collected data from 840 fire and police departments. Findings indicate that few
departments used these online channels in their Sandy response efforts, and
that communications differed between fire and police departments and across
media type. However, among the highly engaged departments, there is evidence
that they bend and adapt policies about what constitutes appropriate public
communication in the face of emergency demands; therefore, we propose that
flexibility is important in considering future emergency online communication
policy. We conclude with design recommendations for making online communication
media more "listenable" for both emergency managers and members of the public.

voice over radio communication tactics and techniques. We designed and

under harsh conditions, wearing Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA). We
conducted 13 full scale training missions including extensive debriefings to

%X Information overload is a systemic problem for knowledge workers in
enterprise. For a long time, information was scarce and therefore valuable.
While, the explosion of digital information has made information plentiful,
time to read and process that content is now scarce. This problem is only
exacerbated by our increased mobility, and the expectation to be "on top" of
the continuous barrage of documents while on the go. Knowledge workers in
enterprise need solutions that are designed with quick methods for finding what
to read in a large collection of documents (e.g. financial reports, legal
documents, news), and ways of presenting it within small visual real estate.
Unlike reviews, document collections are long, more varied, and context is
extremely important. In response, we present Odin, a mobile web-based window
onto a user's document corpus. Rather than performing corpus summarization,
Odin users can quickly find opinions and documents that are Aligned or
Divergent from the corpus' consensus, or those that are the most Relevant given
the overall corpus' of opinions. Odin presents this information through a
simple and intuitive mobile interface. To the authors' knowledge, this is the
first UI/system (and support algorithm) to allow mobile users to place
documents and their opinions in context through alignment rather than raw word
count or sentiment. Positive results from two evaluations are also presented.

navigation. While existing interfaces tend to emphasize either the structure of
the whole or details of a part, monadic exploration brings these opposing
perspectives closer together in continuous movements between partially
overlapping points of view. We present a visualization that reflects a given
node's relative position within a network using radial displacements and visual
folding. To investigate the potential of monadic exploration we report on an
iterative design process of a web-based visualization of a highly

retrospective survey also allows participants to elaborate on those
experiences. Although the use of photos in retrospective interviews and surveys
for memory elicitation is well known, little research has investigated the use
of photos in ESM studies. As smartphone adoption increases facilitating ESM
studies and making photo sharing easier, researchers need to continuously
evaluate the method and investigate the role of photos in such studies. We
conducted a large-scale ESM and retrospective survey study via Android
smartphones with more than 1,000 US participants, and analyzed participants'
photo submissions, including how photo use correlated with participants' data
quality and what, if any, value photos added for researchers. Our study sheds
light on the role of photos in ESM and retrospective studies that researchers
can reference when constructing future study designs.

%X Ontologies have been employed across scientific and business domains for
some time, and the proliferation of linked data means the number and range of
potential authors is set to increase significantly. Ontologies using the Web
Ontology Language (OWL) are complex artefacts, however: the authoring process
requires not only knowledge of the application domain, but also skills in
programming and logics. To date, there has been no systematic attempt to
understand the effectiveness of existing tools, or explore what users really
require to build successful ontologies. Here we address this shortfall,
presenting insights from an interview study with 15 ontology authors. We
identify the problems reported by authors, and the strategies they employ to
solve them. We map the data to a set of design recommendations, which describe
how tools of the future can support ontology authoring. A key challenge is
dealing with information overload: improving the user's ability to navigate,
populate and debug large ontologies will revolutionise the engineering process,
and open ontology authoring up to a new generation of users.

%X Visual exploration of relationships within large, textual datasets is an
important aid for human sensemaking. By understanding computed, structural
relationships between entities of different types (e.g., people and locations),
users can leverage domain expertise and intuition to determine the importance
and relevance of these relationships for tasks, such as intelligence analysis.
Biclusters are a potentially desirable method to facilitate this, because they
reveal coordinated relationships that can represent meaningful relationships.
Bixplorer, a visual analytics prototype, supports interactive exploration of
textual datasets in a spatial workspace with biclusters. In this paper, we
present results of a study that analyzes how users interact with biclusters to
solve an intelligence analysis problem using Bixplorer. We found that
biclusters played four principal roles in the analytical process: an effective
starting point for analysis, a revealer of two levels of connections, an
indicator of potentially important entities, and a useful label for clusters of
organized information.

%X In most cases, speeches or presentations at an international event are
required to be given in a common language (e.g. English). However, for people
who are not proficient in that common language, delivering presentations
fluently is very difficult. Simultaneous translation seems to be a solution,
but besides its high cost, simultaneous translation undermines the nature of
the presentation by substituting the real voice of the lecturer as well as
his/her emotions. In this paper, we propose "SmartVoice", a presentation
support system, which aims to overcome language barriers. By tracking the lip
motion of the lecturer, SmartVoice controls the playback of the narration,
which is a sound data prepared in advance or created automatically using a
voice synthesizer. SmartVoice also controls the intonation of the sound based
on the position and shape of the lecturer's mouth. As the lecturer can talk at
his/her own pace with the voice automatically following, it appears as if
he/she talks in his/her own voice. In our user evaluation, we confirmed that
audiences find it difficult to distinguish between the narration generated by
SmartVoice and that by a real voice. We also discuss the possibility of
applying SmartVoice to fields other than multi-language presentation support,
such as Automated Dialogue Replacement and language study.

%X Rehearsal is a critical component of preparing to give an oral presentation,
yet it is frequently abbreviated, performed in ways that are inefficient or
ineffective, or simply omitted. We conducted an exploratory study to understand
the relationship between the theory and practice of presentation rehearsal,
classifying our qualitative results into five themes to motivate more
structured rehearsal support deeply integrated in slide presentation software.
In a within-subject study (N=12) comparing against participants' existing
rehearsal practices, we found that our resulting PitchPerfect system
significantly improved overall presentation quality and content coverage as
well as provided greater support for content mastery, time management, and
confidence building.

%X Showing a live software demonstration during a talk can be engaging, but it
is often not easy: presenters may struggle with (or worry about) unexpected
software crashes and encounter issues such as mismatched screen resolutions or
faulty network connectivity. Furthermore, it can be difficult to recall the
steps to show while talking and operating the system all at the same time. An
alternative is to present with pre-recorded screencast videos. It is, however,
challenging to precisely match the narration to the video when using existing
video players. We introduce DemoWiz, a video presentation system that provides
an increased awareness of upcoming actions through glanceable visualizations.
DemoWiz supports better control of timing by overlaying visual cues and
enabling lightweight editing. A user study shows that our design significantly
improves the presenters' perceived ease of narration and timing compared to a
system without visualizations that was similar to a standard playback control.
Furthermore, nine (out of ten) participants preferred DemoWiz over the standard
playback control with the last expressing no preference.

(Treatment Advice by Mobile Alerts) that provides treatment support to people
living with HIV / AIDS (PLHA) in developing countries, who are on
antiretroviral therapy (ART). We deployed TAMA with 54 PLHA in 5 HIV clinics in
India for a period of 12 weeks. During the study, we gathered feedback about
TAMA's design and usage. Additionally, we conducted detailed qualitative
interviews and analysed usage logs. We found that TAMA was usable and viable in
the real life settings of PLHA and it had many desirable effects on their
treatment adherence. We developed insights that inform the design of TAMA and
some of these can be generalised to design of other long-term, frequent-use IVR
applications for users in developing countries in the healthcare domain and
beyond.

%X Women comprise nearly half of the immigrant population worldwide and are
susceptible to a wider range of health challenges compared to immigrant men. We
present the findings of four participatory design sessions with immigrant women
from the Caribbean to identify health and wellness challenges they faced and to
conceptualize technologies to help them manage these issues. Stress, dietary
challenges (specifically obesity), mental health, and domestic abuse, as
identified by the women, form the focal themes for the design sessions. Their
design approaches emphasized rebuilding the support structure, reducing
stressors through entertainment and relaxation and encouraging positive
gradational lifestyle changes. In conceiving health and wellness technologies
for immigrant women, our work highlights opportunities for HCI to consider the
role of others (and who benefits) and to reflect on the role of design and the
underlying values and themes designs encompass. Finally, we emphasize how the
technologies conceived by these women support rather than replace social
solutions to the health and wellness challenges faced by these and other
immigrant women.

%X The HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s fundamentally changed sexual practices of
men who have sex with men (MSM) in the U.S., including increased usage of
sexual health-related (SHR) language in personal advertisements. Analyzing
online personal ads from Craigslist, we found a substantial increase in SHR
language, from 23% in 1988 to over 53% today, echoing continuing concern about
rising HIV rates. We argue that SHR language in Craigslist ads can be used as a
sensor to provide insight into HIV epidemiology as well as discourse among
particular communities. We show a positive significant relationship between
prevalence rate of HIV in an ad's location and use of SHR language in that
location. Analysis highlights the opportunity for SHR information found in
Craigslist personal ads to serve as a data source for HIV prevention research.
More broadly, we argue for mining large-scale user-generated content to inform
HCI design of health and other systems, and explore use of such data to examine
temporal changes in language to facilitate improved user-interface design.

%X Research suggests that online health support benefits chronically ill users.
Their satisfaction might be an indicator that they perceive group interactions
as beneficial and a precursor to group commitment. We examined whether
receiving emotional and informational support is satisfying in its own right,
or whether satisfaction depends on matches between what users sought and what
they received. Two studies collected judgments in a breast cancer support
community of support users sought, support they received, and their expressed
satisfaction. While receiving emotional or informational support in general
positively predicted satisfaction, users expressed less satisfaction when they
sought informational support but received emotional support. There was also a
tendency for users to express more satisfaction when they sought and received
informational support. On the other hand, users were equally satisfied with
emotional and informational support after seeking emotional support.
Implications for membership commitment and interventions in online support
groups are discussed.

%X We present the notion of "bridging concepts" as a particular form of
intermediary knowledge in HCI research, residing between theory and practice.
We argue that bridging concepts address the challenge of facilitating exchange
between theory and practice in HCI, and we compare it to other intermediary
forms of knowledge such as strong concepts and conceptual constructs. We
propose that bridging concepts have three defining constituents: a theoretical
foundation, a set of design articulations and a range of exemplars that
demonstrate the scope and potential of their application. These constituents
specify how bridging concepts, as a form of knowledge, are accountable to both
theory and practice. We present an analysis of the concept of "peepholes" as an
example of a bridging concept aimed at spurring user curiosity and engagement.

%X There has been increasing interest in the adoption of UX within corporate
environments, and what competencies translate into effective UX design. This
paper addresses the space between pedagogy and UX practice through the lens of
competence, with the goal of understanding how students are initiated into the
practice community, how their perception of competence shifts over time, and
what factors influence this shift. A 12-week longitudinal data collection,
including surveys and interviews, documents this shift, with participants
beginning internships and full-time positions in UX. Students and early
professionals were asked to assess their level of competence and factors that
influenced competence. A co-construction of identity between the designer and
their environment is proposed, with a variety of factors relating to tool and
representational knowledge, complexity, and corporate culture influencing
perceptions of competence in UX over time. Opportunities for future research,
particularly in building an understanding of competency in UX based on this
preliminary framing of early UX practice are addressed.

%X In this paper we present two design guidelines, causal order and continuity,
to be used as rules of thumb for designing intuitive interactions based on
principles of causal reasoning. We propose that designing interactions to
behave like real-world systems of cause and effect makes them more intuitive.
Using these basic principles avoids the limitations inherent to specific
metaphors. In three experiments, participants solved puzzles using variations
of a novel graphical interface. Participants using interfaces that were
consistent with the causal guidelines consistently solved the puzzle faster
than participants using inconsistent interfaces. We also discuss common
interactions already consistent with the causal guidelines as well as areas
where the guidelines are likely to apply successfully. The causal order
guidelines provide specific utility while also demonstrating how principles of
causal psychology can be applied to help interface designers better convey the
functionality of their interfaces.

%X Gesture-based interactions have become an essential part of the modern user
interface. However, it remains challenging for developers to create gestures
for their applications. This paper studies unistroke gestures, an important
category of gestures defined by their single-stroke trajectories. We present
Gesture Script, a tool for creating unistroke gesture recognizers. Gesture
Script enhances example-based learning with interactive declarative guidance
through rendering scripts and interactively trained parts. The structural
information from the rendering scripts allows Gesture Script to synthesize
gesture variations and generate a more accurate recognizer that also
automatically extracts gesture attributes needed by applications. The results
of our study with developers show that Gesture Script preserves the threshold
of familiar example based gesture tools, while raising the ceiling of the
recognizers created in such tools.

rich and expressive motion gestures performed both on and directly above the
device. Our hardware comprises of low-resolution matrix of infrared (IR)
proximity sensors interspersed between the keys of a regular mechanical
keyboard. This results in coarse but high frame-rate motion data. We extend a
machine learning algorithm, traditionally used for static classification only,
to robustly support dynamic, temporal gestures. We propose the use of motion
signatures a technique that utilizes pairs of motion history images and a
random forest based classifier to robustly recognize a large set of motion
gestures on and directly above the keyboard. Our technique achieves a mean
per-frame classification accuracy of 75.6% in leave-one-subject-out and 89.9%
in half-test/half-training cross-validation. We detail our hardware and gesture
recognition algorithm, provide performance and accuracy numbers, and
demonstrate a large set of gestures designed to be performed with our device.

%X Braille has paved its way into mobile touchscreen devices, providing faster
text input for blind people. This advantage comes at the cost of accuracy, as
chord typing over a flat surface has proven to be highly error prone. A
misplaced finger on the screen translates into a different or unrecognized
character. However, the chord itself gathers information that can be leveraged
to improve input performance. We present B#, a novel correction system for
multitouch Braille input that uses chords as the atomic unit of information
rather than characters. Experimental results on data collected from 11 blind
people revealed that B# is effective in correcting errors at character-level,
thus providing opportunities for instant corrections of unrecognized chords;
and at word-level, where it outperforms a popular spellchecker by providing
correct suggestions for 72% of incorrect words (against 38%). We finish with
implications for designing chord-based correction system and avenues for future
work.

%X In text entry experiments, memorability is a desired property of the phrases
used as stimuli. Unfortunately, to date there is no automated method to achieve
this effect. As a result, researchers have to use either manually curated
English-only phrase sets or sampling procedures that do not guarantee phrases
being memorable. In response to this need, we present a novel sampling method
based on two core ideas: a multiple regression model over language-independent
features, and the statistical analysis of the corpus from which phrases will be
drawn. Our results show that researchers can finally use a method to
successfully curate their own stimuli targeting potentially any language or
domain. The source code as well as our phrase sets are publicly available.

off-the-shelf circuit components with the aim of supporting the durability,
scalability, and accessibility needs of novice and expert circuit builders
alike. We also used electrified notebooks to investigate how the circuit design

%X We propose technology for designing and manufacturing interactive 3D printed
speakers. With the proposed technology, sound reproduction can easily be
integrated into various objects at the design stage and little assembly is
required. The speaker can take the shape of anything from an abstract spiral to
a rubber duck, opening new opportunities in product design. Furthermore, both
audible sound and inaudible ultrasound can be produced with the same design,
allowing for identifying and tracking 3D printed objects in space using common
integrated microphones. The design of 3D printed speakers is based on
electrostatic loudspeaker technology first explored in the early 1930s but not
broadly applied until now. These speakers are simpler than common
electromagnetic speakers, while allowing for sound reproduction at 60 dB levels
with arbitrary directivity ranging from focused to omnidirectional. Our
research of 3D printed speakers contributes to the growing body of work
exploring functional 3D printing in interactive applications.

%X We present a novel approach to the construction of electronic prototypes
which can support a variety of interactive devices. Our technique, which we
call circuit stickers, involves adhering physical interface elements such as
LEDs, sounders, buttons and sensors onto a cheap and easy-to-make substrate
which provides electrical connectivity. This assembly may include control
electronics and a battery for standalone operation, or it can be interfaced to
a microcontroller or PC. In this paper we illustrate different points in the
design space and demonstrate the technical feasibility of our approach. We have
found circuit stickers to be versatile and low-cost, supporting quick and easy
construction of physically flexible interactive prototypes. Building extra
copies of a device is straightforward. We believe this technology has potential
for design exploration, research proto-typing, education and for hobbyist
projects.

%X This paper studies how users perceive their own performance in two
alternative user interfaces. We extend methodology from psychophysics to the
study of interactive performance and conduct two experiments in order to create
a model of users' perception of their own performance. In our studies, two
interfaces are sequentially used in a pointing task, and users are asked to
rate in which interface their performance was higher. We first differentiate
the effects of objective performance (speed and accuracy) versus interface
qualities (distance between elements and width of elements) on perceived
performance. We then derive a model that predicts the amount of change required
in an interface for users to reliably detect a difference. The model is useful
as a heuristic for predicting if a new interface design is better enough for
users to reliably appreciate the obtained gain in user performance. We validate
the model via a separate user study, and conclude by discussing how to apply
our findings to design problems.

%X When a user learns to use a new device, her understanding of it evolves. A
progressive comparison of the evolving user models towards the device target
model, for analysing learning, involves determining the behavioral proximity
between them. To quantify the gap between a user model and a target model, we
introduce an edit distance metric for measuring their behavioral proximity
using a bisimulation-based equivalence relation. We define edit distance to be
the minimum number of edges and states with incident edges required to be
deleted from and/or added to a user model to make it bisimilar to the target
model. We propose an algorithm to compute edit distance between two models and
employ the heuristic procedure on experimental data for computing edit distance
between target and user models. The data is organised into two experiments
depending on the device the user interacted with: (a) a simple device
resembling a vending machine and (b) a close to real-world vehicle transmission
model. The results validate our proposed metric as edit distance converges with
progressive user learning, increases for erroneous learning, and remains
unchanged indicating no learning.

%X Many interfaces have been designed to prevent or reduce errors. These
interfaces may, in fact, reduce the error rate of specific error classes, but
may also have unintended consequences. In this paper, we show a series of
studies where a better interface did not reduce the number of errors but
instead shifted errors from one error class (omissions) to another error class
(perseverations). We also show that having access to progress tracking (a
progress bar) does not reduce the number of errors. We propose and demonstrate
a solution -- a predictive error system -- that reduces errors based on the
error class, not on the type of interface.

%X Simple history systems such as Undo and Redo permit retrieval of earlier or
later interaction states, but advanced systems allow powerful capabilities to
reuse or reapply combinations of commands, states, or data across interaction
contexts. Whether simple or powerful, designing interaction history mechanisms
is challenging. We begin by reviewing existing history systems and models,
observing a lack of tools to assist designers and researchers in specifying,
contemplating, combining, and communicating the behaviour of history systems.
To resolve this problem, we present CAUSALITY, a conceptual model of
interaction history that clarifies the possibilities for temporal interactions.
The model includes components for the work artifact (such as the text and
formatting of a Word document), the system context (such as the settings and
parameters of the user interface), the linear timeline (the commands executed
in real time), and the branching chronology (a structure of executed commands
and their impact on the artifact and/or context, which may be navigable by the
user). We then describe and exemplify how this model can be used to encapsulate
existing user interfaces and reveal limitations in their behaviour, and we also
show in a conceptual evaluation how the model stimulates the design of new and
innovative opportunities for interacting in time.

%X Interactive animated characters have the potential to engage and educate
children, but there is little research on children's interactions with animated
characters and real people. We conducted an experiment with 69 children between
the ages of 4 and 10 years to investigate how they might engage in conversation
differently if their interactive partner appeared as a cartoon character or as
a person. A subset of the participants interacted with characters that
displayed exaggerated and damped facial motion. The children completed two
conversations with an adult confederate who appeared once as herself through
video and once as a cartoon character. We measured how much the children spoke
and compared their gaze and gesture patterns. We asked them to rate their
conversations and indicate their preferred partner. There was no difference in
children's conversation behavior with the cartoon character and the person on
video, even among those who preferred the person and when the cartoon exhibited
altered motion. These results suggest that children will interact with animated
characters as they would another person.

education rather than simple rule setting. We conducted an initial exploratory
qualitative study with results highlighting the importance that parents place
on avoiding inappropriate content. Building on these findings, we designed an
initial prototype which allows parents and children to work together to select
appropriate applications, providing an opportunity for parents to educate their
children on what is appropriate. A second qualitative study with parents and
children in the six to eight year-old age group revealed a favorable response
to this approach. Our results suggest that parents felt that this approach
helped facilitate discussions with their children and made the education more
enjoyable and approachable, and that children may have also learned from the
interaction. In addition, the approach provided some parents with insights into
their children's interests and understanding of their notions of appropriate
and inappropriate content.

describe the design and evaluation of a conversational agent called Spot, with
the goal of engaging children in a 20-questions game. Towards this goal, we
conducted a feasibility study to determine if children's questions are
"on-topic" and suitable for ASR/dialogue systems. We evaluated Spot's
performance at conducting a game of 20-questions against that of a human

%X Exploring large visualizations that do not fit in the screen raises
orientation and navigation challenges. Structuring the space with additional
visual references such as grids or contour lines provide spatial landmarks that
may help viewers form a mental model of the space. However, previous studies
report mixed results regarding their utility. While some evidence showed that
grid and other visual embellishments improve memorability, experiments with
contour lines suggest otherwise. In this work, we describe an evaluation
framework to capture the impact of introducing visual references in node-link
diagrams. We present the results of three controlled experiments that deepen
our understanding on enriching large visualization spaces with visual
structures. In particular, we provide the first tangible evidence that contour
lines have significant benefits when navigating large node-link diagrams.

we address the question of how to adapt. In particular, we present a study to
evaluate a variety of visual prompts, called "interventions", that can be
performed on a visualization to help users process it. Our results show that
some of the tested interventions perform better than a condition in which no
intervention is provided, both in terms of task performance as well as
subjective user ratings. We also discuss findings on how intervention
effectiveness is influenced by individual differences and task complexity.

%X Many sports video games contain elements such as running or throwing that
are based on real-world physical activities, but the translation of these
activities to game controllers means that the original physicality is lost.
This results in games where players have limited opportunity to improve their
physical skills, where there is little differentiation in people's physical
abilities, and where skills do not change over the course of a game. To explore
ways of adding these elements back into sports games, we developed two games
with small-scale physical controls for running and throwing -- one game was a
simple running race, and one was a team-based handball-style game called Jelly
Polo. In two studies (three track-and-field tournaments for the running game,
and a four-week league for Jelly Polo), we observed the effects of physical
controls on gameplay. Our studies showed that the physical controls enabled
substantial individual differences in running and passing skill, allowed people
to increase their expertise over time, and led to fatigue-based changes in
performance during a game. Physical controls increased the games' challenge,
complexity, and unpredictability, and dramatically improved player interest,
expressiveness, and enjoyment. Our work shows that game designers should
consider the idea of "exertion in the small" as a way to improve play
experience in games based on physical activities.

%X Exergames, video game systems that require exertion and interaction, have
been rising in popularity in the past years. However, research on popular
exergames shows mixed health benefits, potentially due to minimal energy
expenditure and decreasing use over time. This paper presents a 2x2
experimental study (N = 44), using a popular exergame, where we vary the
framing of intention (i.e., "Gameplay" or "Exercise") and feedback (i.e.,
"Health" or "No health") to explore their single and interactive impacts on
perceived exertion, objectively measured energy expenditure, affect, and
duration of usage in a single session. Our study showed that participants
primed with exercise used the system significantly longer than those primed
with game play (M = 49.2 &plusmn;2.0 min versus M = 39.3 &plusmn;2.0 min). We
discuss our results and possible design implications based on our
single-session experiment. We conclude with a discussion on the potential
impact of focusing on "healthifying" exergames -- highlighting an exergames"
dual purpose as both a game and exercise -- as opposed to gamifying health
behaviors.

%X Exergame controllers are intended to add fun to monotonous exercise.
However, studies on exergame controllers mostly focus on designing new
controllers and exploring specific application domains without analyzing human
factors, such as performance, comfort, and effort. In this paper, we examine
the characteristics of a speed-based exergame controller that bear on human
factors related to body movement and exercise. Users performed tasks such as
changing and maintaining exercise speed for avatar control while their
performance was measured. The exergame controller follows Fitts' law, but
requires longer movement time than a gamepad and Wiimote. As well, resistance
force and target speed affect performance. User experience data confirm that
the comfort and mental effort are adequate as practical game controllers. The
paper concludes with discussion on applying our findings to practical exergame
design.

%X Interactive gaming has demonstrated promise as a low-cost, at-home training
and fitness instruction alternative. Gaming systems offer convenience and the
ability to provide enhanced reporting and progress data if body measurement
information is collected effectively. However, commercially available systems
today are designed primarily for entertainment and as a result, the quality of
instruction delivery and level of involvement may not meet the needs of a user
performing a disciplined activity.
   This paper will look at adapting for occlusion and lack of visibility;
learning and orientation; and providing feedback in an effort to determine if
there is an ideal visual demonstration delivery that maximizes pose
understanding and user self-efficacy, determine whether supplementary
modalities are important for instruction, and determine if there is an ideal
feedback delivery that promotes pose comprehension, confidence and motivation.
This information can provide a guideline for designing clear and supportive,
interactive training systems that can engage users, prevent injury and help
maintain fitness.

with two classes of 8 to 10 years olds as part of their regular library visits
revealed insights related to how to balance the expectations of a child-at-play
and the requirement to further develop their creative reading and writing
skills. Based on our experiences we recommend that designers create playful
digitally based activities that encourage children to explore libraries and
experience new interactions with physical books.

previous work in narrative visualizations, interactive stories and comics.
Having tested the comic with school boys aged 11-12; we saw patterns in the

which have implications for future designs and analyses of interactive visual

%X Psychophysiological measurement has the potential to play an important role
in audience research. Currently, such research is still in its infancy and it
usually involves collecting data in the laboratory, where during each
experimental session one individual watches a video recording of a performance.
We extend the experimental paradigm by simultaneously measuring Galvanic Skin
Response (GSR) of a group of participants during a live performance. GSR data
were synchronized with video footage of performers and audience. In conjunction
with questionnaire data, this enabled us to identify a strongly correlated main
group of participants, describe the nature of their theatre experience and map
out a minute-by-minute unfolding of the performance in terms of
psycho-physiological engagement. The benefits of our approach are twofold. It
provides a robust and accurate mechanism for assessing a performance. Moreover,
our infrastructure can enable, in the future, real-time feedback from remote
audiences for online performances.

primary task) or had no preference. By contrast, East Asians preferred the rich
interface augmented with security and learning support and felt less anxious

%X Alternative mobility modes for older adults are increasingly important for
economic, ecological and social reasons. A promising option is ridesharing,
defined as use of the same vehicle by two or more people traveling to a common
destination. In particular, mobile computer supported ridesharing provides a
promising way to enlarge older adults' mobility choices in addition to private
driving and public transportation options. In order to understand the
opportunities and obstacles of ridesharing from the point of view of elderly
people, we conducted an interview study in order to examining ridesharing
experiences. It turns out that "mobile independence" and "decisional autonomy"
are key issues for mobile wellbeing. This partially conflicts with common
ridesharing concepts. Hence, we further analyze older adults' strategies
dealing with these conflicts and show that these strategies offer departure
points for the design ridesharing solutions, which are better suited to the
demands of older adults.

%X The advent of the Internet of Things creates an interest in how people might
interrelate through and with networks of internet enabled objects. With an
emphasis on fostering social connection and physical activity among older
people, this preliminary study investigated objects that people over the age of
65 years viewed as significant to them. We conducted contextual interviews in
people's homes about their significant objects in order to understand the role
of the objects in their lives, the extent to which they fostered emotional and
social connections and physical activity, and how they might be augmented
through internet connection.
   Discussion of significant objects generated considerable emotion in the
participants. We identified objects of comfort and routine, objects that
exhibited status, those that fostered independence and connection, and those
that symbolized relationships with loved ones. These findings lead us to
consider implications for the design of interconnected objects.

%X Structured databases achieve effective searching and sorting by enacting
sharply delineated category boundaries around their contents. While this
enables precise retrieval, it also distorts identities that exist between
category lines. A choice between Single and Married, for example, blurs
distinctions within the Single group: single, perhaps, merely because same-sex
marriage is not legal in one's locality. Sociologists Susan Leigh Star and
Geoffrey Bowker describe such residual states as inevitable byproducts of
information systems. To minimize residuality, traditional practice for
descriptive metadata seeks to demarcate clear and objective classes. In this
study, we use critical design to question this position by creating information
collections that foreground the residual, instead of diminishing it. We then
interrogate our design experiments with solicited critical responses from
invited experts and student designers. Inspired by the anthropologist Tim
Ingold, we argue that our experiments illuminate a form of interacting with
databases characterized by notions of wayfaring, or inhabiting a space, as
opposed to notions of transport, or reaching a known destination. We suggest
that the form of coherence that shapes a wayfaring database is enacted through
its flow, or fluid integration between structure and content.

%X Critical Design has emerged as an important concept in HCI research and
practice. Yet researchers have noted that its uptake has been limited by
certain lacks of intellectual infrastructure theories, methodologies, canons
and exemplars, and a community of practice. We argue that one way to create
this infrastructure is to cultivate a community adept at reading that is,
critically interpreting and making reasoned judgments about critical designs.
We propose an approach to developing close readings of critical designs, which
are both evidence-based and carefully reasoned. The approach highlights
analytical units of analysis, the relevance of design languages and social
norms, and the analytical contemplation of critical aspects of a design. It is
intended to be relatively easy to learn, to try out, and to teach, in the hopes
of inviting more members of the HCI community to engage in this practice. We
exemplify the approach with readings of two critical designs and reflect on
different ways that a design might serve a critical purpose or offer a critical
argument about design, society, and the future.

%X We describe the design, implementation and deployment of Photobox, a
domestic technology that prints four or five randomly selected photos from the
owner's Flickr collection at random intervals each month. We deployed Photobox
in three homes for fourteen months, to explore how the slow pace at which it
operates could support experiences of anticipation and re-visitation of the
past. Findings reveal changes in attitude toward the device, from frustration
to eventual acceptance. Participants drew on the photos to reflect on past life
events and reactions indicated a renewed interest for their Flickr collection.
Photobox also provoked reflection on technology in and around the home. These
findings suggest several opportunities, such as designing for anticipation,
better supporting reflection on the past, and, more generally, expanding the
slow technology research program within the HCI community.

%X A central tenet of HCI is that technology should be user-centric, with
designs being based around social science findings about users. Nevertheless a
repeated but critical challenge in design is translating empirical findings
into actionable ideas that inform design, or generating implications for
design. Despite various design methods aiming to bridge this gap, knowledge
informing design is still seen as problematic. However there has been little
empirical exploration into what design researchers understand by such design
knowledge, the functions and principles behind their creation. We report on
interviews with twelve expert HCI design researchers probing the roles and
types of design implications, and the process of generating and evaluating
them. We synthesize different types of design implications into a framework to
guide their generation. Our findings identify a broader range than previously
described, additional sources and heuristics supporting their development as
well some important evaluation criteria. We discuss the value of these findings
for interaction design research.

%X In this paper, we investigate the effects of encumbrance (carrying typical
objects such as shopping bags during interaction) and walking on target
acquisition on a touchscreen mobile phone. Users often hold objects and use
mobile devices at the same time and we examined the impact encumbrance has on
one- and two- handed interactions. Three common input postures were evaluated:
two-handed index finger, one-handed preferred thumb and two-handed both thumbs,
to assess the effects on performance of carrying a bag in each hand while
walking. The results showed a significant decrease in targeting performance
when users were encumbered. For example, input accuracy dropped to 48.1% for
targeting with the index finger when encumbered, while targeting error using
the preferred thumb to input was 4.2mm, an increase of 40% compared to
unencumbered input. We also introduce a new method to evaluate the user's
preferred walking speed when interacting -- PWS&amp;I, and suggest future
studies should use this to get a more accurate measure of the user's input
performance.

%X We present a predictive model for the functional area of the thumb on a
touchscreen surface: the area of the interface reachable by the thumb of the
hand that is holding the device. We derive a quadratic formula by analyzing the
kinematics of the gripping hand. Model fit is high for the thumb-motion
trajectories of 20 participants. The model predicts the functional area for a
given 1) surface size, 2) hand size, and 3) position of the index finger on the
back of the device. Designers can use this model to ensure that a user
interface is suitable for interaction with the thumb. The model can also be
used inversely -- that is, to infer the grips assumed by a given user interface
layout.

gestures that do not make use of explicit mode-switching actions. TilTouch
gestures extend the vocabulary of navigation interfaces by combining motion
tilt with directional touch. We consider sixteen directional TilTouch gestures
that rely on tilt and touch movements along the four main compass directions.
An experiment explores their effectiveness for both one-handed and two-handed
use. Results identify the best combinations of TilTouch gestures in terms of
performance, motor coordination, and user preferences.

%X Tablet computers are often called upon to emulate classical pen-and-paper
input. However, touchscreens typically lack the means to distinguish between
legitimate stylus and finger touches and touches with the palm or other parts
of the hand. This forces users to rest their palms elsewhere or hover above the
screen, resulting in ergonomic and usability problems. We present a
probabilistic touch filtering approach that uses the temporal evolution of
touch contacts to reject palms. Our system improves upon previous approaches,
reducing accidental palm inputs to 0.016 per pen stroke, while correctly
passing 98% of stylus inputs.

%X The translation and rotation of objects with two fingers is a well explored
multitouch technique. However, there are some unsolved questions regarding the
optimal conditions under which this technique functions best. Does it matter in
which direction the movement is oriented? Does parallel or sequential
performance of the two operations work best? This study attempts to answer this
question using a typical Fitts' Law setup but with varying translation-rotation
orientation combinations. The results show that right-oriented movements were
faster and easier than left-oriented ones. Movement combinations which went in
different directions (translation right, rotation left, and vice versa) were
found more tiresome and resulted in more strategy switches compared to
equi-directional combinations. Our findings can inform positioning decisions in
interaction design and contribute to theoretical adjustments to Fitts' Law.

%X We present MotionMontage, a system for recording multiple motion takes of a
rigid virtual object and compositing them together into a montage. Our system
incorporates a Kinect-based performance capture setup that allows animators to
create 3D animations by tracking the motion of a rigid physical object and
mapping it in realtime onto a virtual object. The animator then temporally
annotates the best parts of each take. MotionMontage merges the annotated
motions into a single composite montage using a combination of dynamic time
warping and optimization of a Semi-Markov Conditional Random Field. Our system
also supports the creation of layered animations in which multiple objects are
moving at the same time. To aid the animator in coordinating the motions of the
objects we provide spatial markers which indicate the positions of previously
recorded objects at user-specified points in time. We perform a user study to
evaluate the perceived quality of the montages created with our system and find
that viewers (including both the original animators and new viewers) generally
prefer the animation montage to any individual take.

purposes. This may consist of generating static viewpoints of the model or
authoring animated fly-throughs. Manually creating such views is often tedious
and few automatic methods are designed to interactively assist the modelers
with the view authoring process. We present a view authoring assistance system
that supports the creation of informative view points, view paths, and view
surfaces, allowing modelers to author the interactive navigation experience of
a model. The key concept of our implementation is to analyze the model's
workflow history, to infer important regions of the model and representative
viewpoints of those areas. An evaluation indicated that the viewpoints
generated by our algorithm are comparable to those manually selected by the
modeler. In addition, participants of a user study found our system easy to use
and effective for authoring viewpoint summaries.

%X In this paper, we identify design guidelines for stereoscopic 3D (S3D) user

tools for S3D displays. As auto-stereoscopy becomes available for the mass
market we believe the design of S3D UIs for devices, for example, mobile
phones, public displays, or car dashboards, will rapidly gain importance. A
benefit of such UIs is that they can group and structure information in a way
that makes them easily perceivable for the user. For example, important
information can be shown in front of less important information. This paper
identifies core requirements for designing S3D UIs and derives concrete
guidelines. The requirements also serve as a basis for two depth layout tools
we built with the aim to overcome limitations of traditional prototyping when
sketching S3D UIs. We evaluated the tools with usability experts and compared
them to traditional paper prototyping.

camera motion style -- via an equalizer-like set of controls that manipulates
the power spectra of a video's apparent motion path. We explore free
manipulation of apparent camera motion as well as the transfer of motion styles
from an example video to a new video to create a wide range of stylistic
variations. We report on a user study confirming the ability of non-expert

%X Computers make incredible amounts of information available at our
fingertips. As computers become integral parts of our lives, we spend more time
staring at computer monitor than ever before, sometimes with negative effects.
One major concern is the increasing number of people suffering from Computer
Vision Syndrome (CVS). CVS is caused by extensive use of computers, and its
symptoms include eye fatigue, frequent headaches, dry eyes, and blurred vision.
It is possible to partially alleviate CVS if we can remind users to blink more
often. We present a prototype system that uses a camera to monitor a user's
blink rate, and when the user has not blinked in a while, the system triggers a
blink stimulus. We investigated four different types of eye-blink stimulus:
screen blurring, screen flashing, border flashing, and pop-up notifications.
Users also rated each stimulus type in terms of effectiveness, intrusiveness,
and satisfaction. Results from our user studies show that our stimuli are
effective in increasing user blink rate with screen blurring being the best.

%X Manually selecting subsets of photos from large collections in order to
present them to friends or colleagues or to print them as photo books can be a
tedious task. Today, fully automatic approaches are at hand for supporting
users. They make use of pixel information extracted from the images, analyze
contextual information such as capture time and focal aperture, or use both to
determine a proper subset of photos. However, these approaches miss the most
important factor in the photo selection process: the user. The goal of our
approach is to consider individual interests. By recording and analyzing gaze
information from the user's viewing photo collections, we obtain information on
user's interests and use this information in the creation of personal photo
selections. In a controlled experiment with 33 participants, we show that the
selections can be significantly improved over a baseline approach by up to 22%
when taking individual viewing behavior into account. We also obtained
significantly better results for photos taken at an event participants were
involved in compared with photos from another event.

%X Pupil size is known to correlate with the changes of cognitive task
workloads, but how the pupil responds to requirements of basic goal-directed
motor tasks involved in human-machine interactions is not yet clear. This work
conducted a user study to investigate the pupil dilations during aiming in a
tele-operation setting, with the purpose of better understanding how the
changes in task requirements are reflected by the changes of pupil size. The
task requirements, managed by Fitts' index of difficulty (ID), i.e. the size
and distance apart of the targets, were varied between tasks, and pupil
responses to different task IDs were recorded. The results showed that pupil
diameter can be employed as an indicator of task requirements in goal-directed
movements-higher task difficulty evoked higher valley to peak pupil dilation,
and the peak pupil dilation occurred after a longer delay. These findings
contribute to the foundation for developing methods to objectively evaluate
interactive task requirements using pupil parameters during goal-directed
movements in HCI.

%X May, Dean and Barnard (2003) used a theoretically based model to argue that
objects in a wide range of interfaces should be collocated following screen
changes such as a zoom-in to detail. Many existing online maps do not follow
this principle, but move a clicked point to the centre of the subsequent
display, leaving the user looking at an unrelated location. This paper presents
three experiments showing that collocating the point clicked on a map so that
the detailed location appears in the place previously occupied by the overview
location makes the map easier to use, reducing eye movements and interaction
duration. We discuss the benefit of basing design principles on theoretical
models so that they can be applied to novel situations, and so designers can
infer when to use and not use them.

%X The amount of online educational content is rapidly increasing, particularly
in the form of video lectures. The goal is to design video instruction to
facilitate an experience that maximizes learning and satisfaction. A widely
used but understudied design element in video instruction is the overlay of a
small video of the instructor over lecture slides. We conducted an experiment
with eye-tracking and recall tests to investigate how adding the instructor's
face to video instruction affects information retention, visual attention, and
affect. Participants strongly preferred instruction with the face and perceived
it as more educational. They spent about 41% of time looking at the face and
switched between the face and slide every 3.7 seconds. Consistent with prior
work, no significant difference in short- and medium-term recall ability was
found. Including the face in video instruction is encouraged based on learners'
positive affective response. More fine-grained analytics combining eye-tracking
with detailed learning assessment could shed light on the mechanisms by which
the face aids or hinders learning.

opportunities to engage students in novel and potentially transformative
learning experiences. This paper presents an immersive rainforest simulation
and collective inquiry activity where students collect observational data from
the environment and explore their peers' data through large visualization
displays and personal mobile devices. Two iterations of the design were tested,
which resulted in higher quality student explanations constructed. Images were
found to be an important source of evidence for the explanations, more so than
text-only evidence. We also found that patterns of collective ideas influenced
student performance, and that visualizations, as ambient or plenary displays,
supported both teacher and students in reviewing patterns of collected data.

%X Learning the practices and the performance of physically manipulating
instruments in minimally invasive surgeries is an impetus for the development
of surgical training simulators. However, an often-overlooked aspect of
surgical training is learning how to see the body through the various imaging
mechanisms. With this study, we address the ways in which surgeons demonstrate
and instruct residents in seeing the body during minimally invasive surgical
procedures. Drawing on observations and analysis of video recordings of
minimally invasive surgical operations, we examine how particular anatomy and
movement within the body to see and conceptualize that anatomy are made visible
by the instructive practices of the surgeon. We use these findings to discuss
further directions for minimally invasive surgical training through mechanisms
for making the body visible during situated surgical training and surgical
training simulation systems.

%X The propagation of Inquiry Based Learning has lead to many more elementary
students interacting with authentic scientific tools and practices. However,
the more problematic realities of scientific data collection, such as noise and
large data sets, are often deliberately hidden from students. Students will
need to confront these realities and be able to make skillful data scoping
decisions in order to make sense of ever more prevalent large datasets. We dub
software designed to support these activities Information-Building Applications
(IBAs). This paper presents the design considerations that went into building
an exemplar IBA, PhotoMAT (Photo Management and Analysis Tool), a brief user
study to show how the solutions enacted by following these principles are taken
up by actual students, and a discussion of how the design considerations
identified by our work might be applied to another IBA.

%X Since past studies on haptic and visual communication have tended to be
isolated from each other, it has remained unclear whether a touch channel can
still enrich mediated communication where video and audio channels are already
available. To clarify this, we analyzed remote handshaking in which a robot
hand that was attached just under a videoconferencing terminal's display moved
according to the opening and closing motion of a conversation partner's hand.
Combining touch and video channels raises a question as to whether the
partner's action of touching a haptic device should be visible to the user. If
it can be invisible, the action may be unnecessary, and a unilaterally
controlled device may be enough to establish an effective touch channel. Our
analysis revealed that the feeling of being close to the partner can be
enhanced by mutual touch in which the partner's action needs to occur but
should be invisible.

%X Robotic telepresence systems -- videoconferencing systems that allow a
remote user to drive around in another location -- provide an alternative to
video-mediated communications as a way of interacting over distances. These
systems, which are seeing increasing use in business and medical settings, are
unique in their ability to grant the remote user the ability to maneuver in a
distant location. While this mobility promises increased feelings of "being
there" for remote users and thus greater support for task collaboration,
whether these promises are borne out, providing benefits in task performance,
is unknown. To better understand the role that mobility plays in shaping the
remote user's sense of presence and its potential benefits, we conducted a
two-by-two (system mobility: stationary vs. mobile; task demands for mobility:
low vs. high) controlled laboratory experiment. We asked participants (N=40) to
collaborate in a construction task with a confederate via a robotic
telepresence system. Our results showed that mobility significantly increased
the remote user's feelings of presence, particularly in tasks with high
mobility requirements, but decreased task performance. Our findings highlight
the positive effects of mobility on feelings of "being there," while
illustrating the need to design support for effective use of mobility in
high-mobility tasks.

%X Our research explores the use of mobile video chat in public spaces by
people participating in parallel experiences, where both a local and remote
person are doing the same activity together at the same time. We prototyped a
wearable video chat experience and had pairs of friends and family members
participate in 'shared geocaching' over distance. Our results show that video
streaming works best for navigation tasks but is more challenging to use for
fine-grained searching tasks. Video streaming also creates a very intimate
experience with a remote partner, but this can lead to distraction from the
'real world' and even safety concerns. Overall, privacy concerns with streaming
from a public space were not typically an issue; however, people tended to rely
on assumptions of what were acceptable. The implications are that designers
should consider appropriate feedback, user disembodiment, and asymmetry when
designing for parallel experiences.

%X Gaze, attention, and eye contact are important aspects of face to face
communication, but some subtleties can be lost in videoconferencing because
participants look at a single planar image of the remote user. We propose a
low-cost cylindrical videoconferencing system that preserves gaze direction by
providing perspective-correct images for multiple viewpoints around a
conference table. We accomplish this by using an array of cameras to capture a
remote person, and an array of projectors to present the camera images onto a
cylindrical screen. The cylindrical screen reflects each image to a narrow
viewing zone. The use of such a situated display allows participants to see the
remote person from multiple viewing directions. We compare our system to three
alternative display configurations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
system by showing it allows multiple participants to simultaneously tell where
the remote person is placing their gaze.

%X Movement-based digital games typically make it clear whose movement
representation belongs to which player. In contrast, we argue that selectively
concealing whose movement controls which representation can facilitate engaging
play experiences. We call this "innominate movement representation" and explore
this opportunity through our game "i-dentity", where players have to guess who
makes everyone's controller light up based on his/her movements. Our work
reveals five dimensions for the design of innominate movement representation:
concealing the association between movement and representation; number of
represented movements; number of players with representations; location of
representation in relation to the body and technical attributes of
representation. We also present five strategies for how innominate
representation can be embedded into a play experience. With our work we hope to
expand the range of digital movement games.

the guidelines using current findings about movement-based game and interaction
design, taken from both published research papers and game design venues. Our
primary contribution is a body of generative intermediate-level knowledge in
the design research tradition that is readily accessible and actionable for the

%X Game balancing can help players with different skill levels play multiplayer
games together; however, little is known about how the balancing approach
affects performance, experience, and self-esteem'especially when differences in
player strength result from given abilities, rather than learned skill. We
explore three balancing approaches in a dance game and show that the explicit
approach commonly used in commercial games reduces self-esteem and feelings of
relatedness in dyads, whereas hidden balancing improves self-esteem and reduces
score differential without affecting game outcome. We apply our results in a
second study with dyads where one player had a mobility disability and used a
wheelchair. By making motion-based games accessible for people with different
physical abilities, and by enabling people with mobility disabilities to
compete on a par with able-bodied peers, we show how to provide empowering
experiences through enjoyable games that have the potential to increase
physical activity and self-esteem.

%X Pixel-based methods offer unique potential for modifying existing interfaces
independent of their underlying implementation. Prior work has demonstrated a
variety of modifications to existing interfaces, including accessibility
enhancements, interface language translation, testing frameworks, and
interaction techniques. But pixel-based methods have also been limited in their
understanding of the interface and therefore the complexity of modifications
they can support. This work examines deeper pixel-level understanding of
widgets and the resulting capabilities of pixel-based runtime enhancements.
Specifically, we present three new sets of methods: methods for pixel-based
modeling of widgets in multiple states, methods for managing the combinatorial
complexity that arises in creating a multitude of runtime enhancements, and
methods for styling runtime enhancements to preserve consistency with the
design of an existing interface. We validate our methods through an
implementation of Moscovich et al.'s Sliding Widgets, a novel runtime
enhancement that could not have been implemented with prior pixel-based
methods.

%X CommandMaps are a promising interface technique that flattens command
hierarchies and exploits human spatial memory to provide rapid access to

studies, but have not yet been tested in the context of real tasks. In this
paper we present two real-world implementations of CommandMaps: one for
Microsoft Word and one for an image editing program called Pinta. We use these
as our experimental platforms in two experiments. In the first, we show that
CommandMaps demonstrate performance and subjective advantages in a realistic
task. In the second, we observe naturalistic use of CommandMaps over the course
of a week, and gather qualitative data from interviews, questionnaires, and
conversations. Our results provide substantial insight into users' reactions to
CommandMaps, showing that they are positively received by users and allowing us
to provide concrete recommendations to designers regarding when and how they
should be implemented in real applications.

of objects with points allows us to transform the labeling problem to graph
layout problem, which we solve by means of force-based algorithm. The input
parameters allow us to influence the resulting layout of label boxes (e.g. to
adapt their distance for imprecise input devices). In a study with 15
participants two implementations of our algorithm were compared against
labeling method, where all label boxes share the same offset from corresponding
objects. The results of the study show that implementation using a special
functionality (temporary freezing of the label box position recalculation) was
14% faster with a comparable accuracy. The subjective evaluation revealed that
the implementation with temporary freezing is perceived as most comfortable,
fastest and most accurate. The implementation without temporary freezing showed
much higher error rate and cannot be recommended.

%X Medication taking is a self-regulatory process that requires individuals to
self-monitor their medication taking behaviors, but this can be difficult
because medication taking is such a mundane, unremarkable behavior. Ubiquitous
sensing systems have the potential to sense everyday behaviors and provide the
objective feedback necessary for self-regulation of medication taking. We
describe an unobtrusive sensing system consisting of a sensor-augmented pillbox
and an ambient display that provides near real-time visual feedback about how
well medications are being taken. In contrast to other systems that focus on
reminding before medication taking, our approach uses feedback after medication
taking to allow the individual to develop their own routines through
self-regulation. We evaluated this system in the homes of older adults in a
10-month deployment. Feedback helped improve the consistency of
medication-taking behaviors as well as increased ratings of self-efficacy.
However, the improved performance did not persist after the feedback display
was removed, because individuals had integrated the feedback display into their
routines to support their self-awareness, identify mistakes, guide the timing
of medication taking, and provide a sense of security that they are taking
their medications well. Finally, we reflect on design considerations for
feedback systems to support the process of self-regulation of everyday
behaviors.

%X Despite the fact that a third of all cases of unintentional medication
non-adherence are caused by simple forgetfulness, the majority of interventions
neglect this issue. Even though patients have access to smartphone applications
("apps") designed to help them remember medication, neither their quality nor
effectiveness has been evaluated yet. We report the findings of a functionality
review of 229 medication reminder apps and a thematic analysis of their 1,012
user reviews. Our research highlights the gap between the theory and practice:
while the literature shows that many medication regimens are habitual in nature
and the presence of daily routines supports remembering, existing apps rely on
timer-based reminders. To address this disparity, we present design
requirements for building medication reminders that support the routine aspect
of medication-taking and its individual nature, and demonstrate how they could
be implemented to move from passive alerts to a smarter memory and routine
assistant.

%X The tracking of developmental milestones in young children is an important
public health goal for ensuring early detection and treatment for developmental
delay. While numerous paper-based and web-based solutions are available for
tracking milestones, many busy parents often forget to enter information on a
regular basis. To help address this need, we have developed an interactive
system called @BabySteps for allowing parents who use Twitter to track and
respond to tweets about developmental milestones using a special hashtag
syntax. Parent responses are parsed automatically and written into a central
database that can be accessed via the web. We deployed @BabySteps with 14
parents over a 3-week period and found that parents were able to learn how to
use the system to track their children's progress, with some using it to
communicate with other parents. The study helped to identify a number of ways
to improve the approach, including simplifying the hashtag syntax, allowing for
private responses via direct messaging, and improving the social component. We
provide a discussion of lessons learned and suggestions for the design of
interactive public health systems.

screening test. A user study conducted at Singapore National Eye Centre on
twenty-eight children, identified fourteen as Red-Green deficient subjects as
did by Ishihara screening test, showed that DoDo was adequately effective in
identifying Red-Green color vision deficiency and comparable to two current
gold standard colorblind tests, Ishihara and D15.

%X Given the proliferation of devices like infusion pumps in hospitals, number
entry and in particular number entry error is an emerging important concern in
HCI. There are clearly design features that could greatly improve accuracy in
entering numbers but the context of the task could also play an important role.
In particular, the emotional state of a person is known to strongly influence
their response to a difficult situation and hence the errors that they make. In
this paper, we consider the impact of the emotional state of the user on the
accuracy with which people enter numbers. Our experiment shows that
participants who are in a more positive emotional state are more accurate. The
effect is small but could be very important when considering the potentially
highly-charged emotional contexts where many healthcare devices are used.

%X Correcting erroneous input (i.e., correction) and completing a word based on
partial input (i.e., completion) are two important "smart" capabilities of a
modern intelligent touchscreen keyboard. However little is known whether these
two capabilities are conflicting or compatible with each other in the keyboard
parameter tuning. Applying computational optimization methods, this work
explores the optimality issues related to them. The work demonstrates that it
is possible to simultaneously optimize a keyboard algorithm for both correction
and completion. The keyboard simultaneously optimized for both introduces no
compromise to correction and only a slight compromise to completion when
compared to the keyboards exclusively optimized for one objective. Our research
also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method in
keyboard algorithm design, which is based on the Pareto multi-objective
optimization and the Metropolis algorithm. For the development and test
datasets used in our experiments, computational optimization improved the
correction accuracy rate by 8.3% and completion power by 17.7%.

%X Users often struggle to enter text accurately on touchscreen keyboards. To
address this, we present a flexible decoder for touchscreen text entry that
combines probabilistic touch models with a language model. We investigate two
different touch models. The first touch model is based on a Gaussian Process
regression approach and implicitly models the inherent uncertainty of the
touching process. The second touch model allows users to explicitly control the
uncertainty via touch pressure. Using the first model we show that the
character error rate can be reduced by up to 7% over a baseline method, and by
up to 1.3% over a leading commercial keyboard. Using the second model we
demonstrate that providing users with control over input certainty reduces the
amount of text users have to correct manually and increases the text entry
rate.

%X This paper addresses the phenomenon of emotional attachments to mobile
phones. We introduce the term "mobile attachment" and define it as a bond
between a person's self and a mobile phone that varies in strength. Based on a
critical reflection of interdisciplinary literature, a conceptual mobile
attachment model is developed. Within this model causes, consequences and
influencing factors of mobile attachment are exposed and elaborated. We argue
that mobile attachment emerges when the mobile phone becomes part of the user's
self concept. The link between the user and their mobile phone may be fostered
when it empowers, enriches, or gratifies the user's self. Attachment causes
lead to "design space determinants" that enable user experience designers to
design for mobile attachment. Attachment consequences may be operationalized
for user experience evaluation.

%X The negative aspects of smartphone overuse on young adults, such as sleep
deprivation and attention deficits, are being increasingly recognized recently.
This emerging issue motivated us to analyze the usage patterns related to
smartphone overuse. We investigate smartphone usage for 95 college students
using surveys, logged data, and interviews. We first divide the participants
into risk and non-risk groups based on self-reported rating scale for
smartphone overuse. We then analyze the usage data to identify between-group
usage differences, which ranged from the overall usage patterns to app-specific
usage patterns. Compared with the non-risk group, our results show that the
risk group has longer usage time per day and different diurnal usage patterns.
Also, the risk group users are more susceptible to push notifications, and tend
to consume more online content. We characterize the overall relationship
between usage features and smartphone overuse using analytic modeling and
provide detailed illustrations of problematic usage behaviors based on
interview data.

smartphone interaction. We gathered a dataset consisting of 95 closeup images
of damaged smartphones and extensive information about a device's usage
history, damage severity, and impact on use. 88% of our participants continued
to use their damaged smartphone for at least three months; 32% plan to use it
for another year or more, mainly due to high repair and replacement costs. From
the dataset, we identified three categories of damaged smartphone displays.
Reading and text input were most affected. Further interviews (n=11) revealed
that users adapt to damage with diverse coping strategies, closely tailored to
specific interaction issues. In total, we identified 23 different strategies.
Based on our results, we proposed guidelines for interaction design in order to
provide a positive user experience when display damage occurs.

However, users can be surprised when informed of the data collection and
distribution activities of apps they install. We report on two studies of
smartphone users in western European countries, in which users were confronted
with app behaviors and their reactions assessed. Users felt their personal
space had been violated in "creepy" ways. Using Altman's notions of personal
space and territoriality, and Nissenbaum's theory of contextual integrity, we
account for these emotional reactions and suggest that they point to important
underlying issues, even when users continue using apps they find creepy.

our work presents details of the first significant attempt at a system that
integrates future pervasive display networks and mobile devices to support
display personalisation. We describe a series of usage models and design goals
for display personalisation and then present Tacita, a system that supports
these models and goals. Our architecture includes mobile, display and
cloud-based elements and provides comprehensive personalisation features while
preventing the creation of user profiles within the display infrastructure,
thus helping to preserve users' privacy. An initial evaluation of our prototype
implementation of the architecture is also included and demonstrates the
viability of the Tacita approach.

regret some of their online disclosures. To help individuals avoid such
regrets, we designed two modifications to the Facebook web interface that nudge
users to consider the content and audience of their online disclosures more
carefully. We implemented and evaluated these two nudges in a 6-week field
trial with 28 Facebook users. We analyzed participants' interactions with the
nudges, the content of their posts, and opinions collected through surveys. We
found that reminders about the audience of posts can prevent unintended
disclosures without major burden; however, introducing a time delay before
publishing users' posts can be perceived as both beneficial and annoying. On
balance, some participants found the nudges helpful while others found them
unnecessary or overly intrusive. We discuss implications and challenges for
designing and evaluating systems to assist users with online disclosures.

%X Augmented reality (AR) devices are poised to enter the market. It is unclear
how the properties of these devices will affect individuals' privacy. In this
study, we investigate the privacy perspectives of individuals when they are
bystanders around AR devices. We conducted 12 field sessions in caf&eacute;s
and interviewed 31 bystanders regarding their reactions to a co-located AR
device. Participants were predominantly split between having indifferent and
negative reactions to the device. Participants who expressed that AR devices
change the bystander experience attributed this difference to subtleness, ease
of recording, and the technology's lack of prevalence. Additionally,
participants surfaced a variety of factors that make recording more or less
acceptable, including what they are doing when the recording is being taken.
Participants expressed interest in being asked permission before being recorded
and in recording-blocking devices. We use the interview results to guide an
exploration of design directions for privacy-mediating technologies.

processes of everyday ideation. That is, they use digital found objects as
creative resources to develop ideas for shaping their lives. Curators assemble
information into new contexts, forming and sharing ideas with practical and
emotional value. We investigate cognitive and social aspects of creativity that
affect the digital curation practices of everyday ideation. We derive
implications for the design of curation environments that support
information-based ideation.

qualitatively examine 1,149 user comments posted to the Facebook's official

users' perceptions about the launch of Timeline. Our data suggests a high level
of stress associated with the transition to the new interface introduced by
Timeline. We also found evidence which suggests that increasing users'
perceptions of control over major interface changes may help facilitate user
adaptation to these changes. This study offers valuable insights to SNSs for
mitigating user stress and facilitating successful adaptation during major
interface changes.

%X Content generation on social network sites has been considered mainly from
the perspective of individuals interacting with social network contacts. Yet
research has also pointed to the potential for social media to become a
meaningful personal archive over time. The aim of this paper is to consider how
social media, over time and across sites, forms part of the wider digital
archiving space for individuals. Our findings, from a qualitative study of 14
social media users, highlight how although some sites are more associated with
'keepable' social media than others, even those are not seen as archives in the
usual sense of the word. We show how this perception is bound up with five
contradictions, which center on social media as curated, as a reliable
repository of meaningful content, as readily encountered and as having the
potential to present content as a compelling narrative. We conclude by
highlighting opportunities for design relating to curation through use and what
this implies for personal digital archives, which are known to present
difficulties in terms of curation and re-finding.

followed 2,234 live-tweeters from the show's premiere episode to its finale,
finding that nearly a third of users returned each week to tweet.
Semi-structured interviews with 11 diverse live-tweeters revealed that the
decision to live-tweet is dependent upon a variety of personal considerations
and social conventions forming around this emerging TV viewing practice. This
includes the desire to feel connected to a larger community that is interested
in the show. Participants actively sought to protect the user experience of
others by following good live-tweeting "etiquette", including limiting their
number of posts and censoring content that might spoil the show for others.
Over time, live-tweeting helped users build and maintain a network of fellow
Downton Abbey viewers with shared interests.

%X On the basis of an ethnographic field study, this article introduces the
concept of documentscape to the analysis of document-centric work practices.
The concept of documentscape refers to the entire ensemble of documents in
their mutual intertextual interlocking. Providing empirical data from a global
software development case, we show how hierarchical structures and
sequentiality across the interlocked documents are critical to how actors make
sense of the work of others and what to do next in a geographically distributed
setting. Furthermore, we found that while each document is created as part of a
quasi-sequential order, this characteristic does not make the document, as a
single entity, into a stable object. Instead, we found that the documents were
malleable and dynamic while suspended in intertextual structures. Our concept
of documentscape points to how the hierarchical structure, sequentiality, and
authorless nature of documents serve as a constitutive platform for the
development of iterative and emergent work practices, making it possible for
highly distributed actors to collaborate with limited communication, as the
documentscape serves as a vehicle of coordination.

%X Many teams are now adopting shared repositories for their work. Such
adoption is paradoxical, however, as past research has repeatedly shown major
co-organizational barriers; teams cannot agree a common organizational scheme,
making it difficult to retrieve information organized by others. Another
barrier is email competition; email provides a reliable alternative for
distributing files that are then personally organized. To address this paradox,
we explored how 27 participants actively using shared repositories overcome
these barriers in a qualitative study. We found teams addressed co-organization
using 4 strategies. First they create ContentMaps that provide explicit
structure to organize shared information. Participants also co-organize using
implicit strategies based on task structure, expertise, and tool affordances.
Greater shared repository use also leads to a changed role for email.
Versioning problems mean email is not used for distributing attachments,
instead for task management. We present technical implications suggesting how
new tools might be better integrated with email facilitating these continued
email uses.

literatures called the Interdisciplinary Literacy Framework and use it to
highlight gaps in our understanding of information literacy that HCI as a field
is particularly well suited to fill. We report on two studies that lay a
foundation for developing guidelines for assessable information system design.
The first is a study of Wikipedians', librarians', and laypersons' information
assessment practices from which we derive two important features of assessable
designs: information provenance and stewardship. The second is an experimental
study in which we operationalize these concepts in designs and test them using
Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).

that users quickly adopted strategies that are unique to always-on, real-time

%X While emergent behaviors are uncodified across many domains such as
programming and writing, interfaces need explicit rules to support users. We
hypothesize that by codifying emergent programming behavior, software
engineering interfaces can support a far broader set of developer needs. To
explore this idea, we built Codex, a knowledge base that records common
practice for the Ruby programming language by indexing over three million lines
of popular code. Codex enables new data-driven interfaces for programming
systems: statistical linting, identifying code that is unlikely to occur in
practice and may constitute a bug; pattern annotation, automatically
discovering common programming idioms and annotating them with metadata using
expert crowdsourcing; and library generation, constructing a utility package
that encapsulates and reflects emergent software practice. We evaluate these
applications to find Codex captures a broad swatch of programming practice,
statistical linting detects problematic code snippets, and pattern annotation
discovers nontrivial idioms such as basic HTTP authentication and database
migration templates. Our work suggests that operationalizing practice-driven
knowledge in structured domains such as programming can enable a new class of
user interfaces.

%X In recent years there has been a shift in microprocessor manufacture from
building single-core processors towards providing multiple cores on the same
chip. This shift has meant that a much wider population of developers are faced
with the task of developing parallel software: a difficult, time consuming and
expensive process. With the aim of identifying issues, emerging practices and
design opportunities for support, we present in this paper a qualitative study
in which we interviewed a range of software developers, in both industry and
academia. We then perform a systematic analysis of the data and identify
several cross-cutting themes. These analysis themes include the practical
relevance of the probe effect, the significance of orchestration models in
development and the mismatch between currently available tools and developers'
needs. We also identify an important characteristic of parallel programming,
where the process of optimisation goes hand in hand with the process of
debugging, as opposed to clearer distinctions which may be made in traditional
programming. We conclude with reflection on how the study can inform the design
of software tools to support developers in the endeavour of parallel
programming.

%X Increasingly, people are faced with navigating large information spaces, and
making such navigation efficient is of paramount concern. In this paper, we
focus on the problems programmers face in navigating large code bases, and
propose a novel code editor, Patchworks, that addresses the problems. In
particular, Patchworks leverages two new interface idioms -- the patch grid and
the ribbon -- to help programmers navigate more quickly, make fewer navigation
errors, and spend less time arranging their code. To validate Patchworks, we
conducted a user study that compared Patchworks to two existing code editors:
the traditional file-based editor, Eclipse, and the newer canvas-based editor,
Code Bubbles. Our results showed (1) that programmers using Patchworks were
able to navigate significantly faster than with Eclipse (and comparably with
Code Bubbles), (2) that programmers using Patchworks made significantly fewer
navigation errors than with Code Bubbles or Eclipse, and (3) that programmers
using Patchworks spent significantly less time arranging their code than with
Code Bubbles (and comparably with Eclipse).

%X Patients with Parkinson's disease often experience freezing of gait, which
bears a high risk of falling, a prevalent cause for morbidity and mortality. In
this work we present GaitAssist, a wearable system for freezing of gait support
in daily life. The system provides real-time auditory cueing after the onset of
freezing episodes. Furthermore, GaitAssist implements training exercises to
learn how to handle freezing situations. GaitAssist is the result of a design
process where we considered the input of engineers, clinicians and 18
Parkinson's disease patients, in order to find an optimal trade-off between
system wearability and performance. We tested the final system in a user study
with 5 additional patients. They reported a reduction in the freezing of gait
duration as a result of the auditory stimulation provided, and that they feel
the system enhanced their confidence during walking.

%X Physical therapists could make better treatment decisions if they had
accurate patient home exercise data but today this information is only
available from patient self-report. A more accurate source of data could be
gained from wearable computing designed for physical therapy exercise support.
Existing systems have been tested in the lab but we have little information
about issues they may face in home settings. We designed a technology probe,
SenseCap, and deployed it for seven days in ten physical therapy patients'
homes. SenseCap is a wearable physical therapy support system that gathers
patient exercise compliance and performance data and summarizes the data in
charts on an iPad Dashboard for physical therapists to view when patients
return to the clinic. In this paper, we present the results of our deployment,
show in-home patient exercise data gathered by the probe, and make design
recommendations based on patient and physical therapist responses.

hall and a shopping mall. We have gathered insights from more than 120 people,
with regard to how users experience and make sense of the bench's shape
changing capability. The paper applies McCarthy and Wright's six different
sense making processes (anticipating, connecting, interpreting, reflecting,
appropriating and recounting) as an instrument to analyse people's experience
with shape-changing furniture in the wild. The paper also introduces exploring
as a seventh sense making process. Based on this analysis, the paper points to
three relevant aspects when designing shape-changing artefacts for the wild,
namely: 1) Affordance of shape-changing interfaces, 2) Transitions between
background and foreground and 3) Interpreting physically dynamic objects.

people's innate abilities for manipulating physical objects in the real world.

concept. Additionally, we explore the interaction techniques enabled by this
concept and conduct an in-depth study to evaluate our transformable physical
controls. Our findings show that these physical controls provide several
benefits over traditional touch interaction techniques commonly used on mobile
devices.

%X Shape-changing handheld devices are emerging as research prototypes, but it
is unclear how users perceive them and which experiences they engender. The
little data we have on user experience is from single prototypes, only covering
a small part of the possibilities in shape change. We produce 51 videos of a
shape-changing handheld device by systematically varying seven parameters of
shape change. In a crowd-sourced study, 187 participants watched the videos and
described their experiences using rating scales and free text. We find
significant and large differences among parameters of shape change. Shapes that
have previously been used for notifications were rated the least urgent; the
degree of shape change was found to impact experience more than type of shape
change. The experience of shape change was surprisingly complex: hedonic
quality were inversely related to urgency, and some shapes were perceived as
ugly, yet useful. We discuss how to advance models of shape change and improve
research on the experience of shape change.

%X Audio and vibrotactile output are the standard mechanisms mobile devices use
to attract their owner's attention. Yet in busy and noisy environments, or when
the user is physically active, these channels sometimes fail. Recent work has
explored the use of physical shape-change as an additional method for conveying
notifications when the device is in-hand or viewable. However, we do not yet
understand the effectiveness of physical shape-change as a method for
communicating in-pocket notifications. This paper presents three robustly
implemented, mobile-device sized shape-changing devices, and two user studies
to evaluate their effectiveness at conveying notifications. The studies reveal
that (1) different types and configurations of shape-change convey different
levels of urgency and; (2) fast pulsing shape-changing notifications are missed
less often and recognised more quickly than the standard slower vibration pulse
rates of a mobile device.

%X Advances in shape changing assemblies have been made in reconfiguration
algorithms, hardware designs and interaction techniques. However no tools exist
for guiding designers in building those modular devices and especially for
choosing the shape of the units. The task becomes even more complex when the
units themselves can change their shapes to animate the entire assembly. In
this paper, we contribute with the first analysis tool which helps the designer
to both choose the right subset of forms for the units and to create an
assembly with maximum accuracy from the set of given objects. We introduce the
concept of Changibles that are interactive wireless units that can reshape
themselves and be attached together to create an animated assembly. We present
a use case to demonstrate the use of our tool, with an instantiation of six
Changibles that are used to construct a pulsing heart assembly.

%X In recent years, touch screens have emerged and matured as the main input
interface for mobile and tablet computers calling for extended touch input
possibilities. In this paper, we explore the use of consecutive distant taps to
expand the touch screen input vocabulary. We analyzed time intervals and
distances between consecutive taps during common applications on a tablet and
verified that consecutive distant taps can be used conflict-free with existing
touch gestures. We designed the two interaction techniques Ta-tap and Ta-Ta-tap
that utilize consecutive distant taps. Ta-tap uses two consecutive distant taps
to invoke alternative touch operations for multi-touch emulation, whereas
Ta-Ta-tap uses a series of consecutive distant taps to define a spatial
gesture. We verified the feasibility of both interaction techniques through a
series of experiments and a user study. The high recognition rate of Ta-tap and
Ta-Ta-tap gestures, the few conflicts with existing gestures, and the positive
feedback from the participants assert the potential of consecutive distant taps
as a new design space to enrich touch screen interactions.

%X Touch input is increasingly popular nowadays, especially for mobile devices
such as smartphones and tablet computers. However, the human finger has
considerably large fingertip size and finger input is imprecise. As such,
acquiring small targets on a touch screen is still a challenging task. In this
paper, we present the LinearDragger, a new and integrated one-finger target
acquisition technique for small and clustered targets. The proposed method has
three advantages. First, it allows users to select targets in dense clustered
groups easily with a single touch-drag-release operation. Second, it maps the
2D selection problem into a more precise 1D selection problem, which is
independent of the target distribution. Third, it avoids finger occlusion and
does not create visual distraction. As a result, it is particularly suitable
for applications with dense targets and rich visual elements. Results of our
controlled experiments show that when selecting small targets, LinearDragger
takes about 70% and 30% less selection time than target acquisition without
using any techniques and with the state-of-the-art target acquisition technique
that involves a single touch operation, respectively, while maintaining a
reasonable error rate.

%X Touch-based tablet UIs provide few shortcut mechanisms for rapid command
selection; as a result, command selection on tablets often requires slow
traversal of menus. We developed a new selection technique for multi-touch
tablets, called FastTap, that uses thumb-and-finger touches to show and choose
from a spatially-stable grid-based overlay interface. FastTap allows novices to
view and inspect the full interface, but once item locations are known, FastTap
allows people to select commands with a single quick thumb-and-finger tap. The
interface helps users develop expertise, since the motor actions carried out as
a novice rehearse the expert behavior. A controlled study showed that FastTap
was significantly faster (by 33% per selection overall) than marking menus,
both for novices and experts, and without reduction in accuracy or subjective
preference. Our work introduces a new and efficient selection mechanism that
supports rapid command execution on touch tablets, for both novices and
experts.

%X Fundamental performance results for crossing-based selection tasks with
direct touch input are presented. A close adaptation of Accot and Zhai's
indirect stylus crossing experiment reveals similar trends for direct touch
input: touch crossing task time is faster or equivalent to touch pointing;
continuous selection of large orthogonal crossing targets is most effective;
and continuous selection of small collinear targets is least effective. Unlike
indirect stylus and mouse crossing, not every kind of direct touch pointing
performance is modeled accurately with standard Fitts' law. Instead, Fitts'
law, used previously for touch pointing with small targets, is used to more
accurately model discrete touch crossing with a directionally constrained
target. In addition, visual touch feedback is shown to have a strong effect on
absolute accuracy. Our work empirically validates touch crossing as a practical
and efficient selection technique, and motivates the exploration of novel forms
of expressive multi-touch crossing.

computer algorithms masquerading as people. While CAPTCHAs are generally
effective at stopping abuse, they might impair website usability if they are
not properly designed. In this paper we describe how we designed two new
CAPTCHA schemes for Google that focus on maximizing usability. We began by
running an evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk with over 27,000 respondents to
test the usability of different feature combinations. Then we studied user
preferences using Google's consumer survey infrastructure. Finally, drawing on
the insights gleaned during those studies, we tested our new captcha schemes
first on Mechanical Turk and then on a fraction of production traffic. The
resulting scheme is now an integral part of our production system and is served
to millions of users. Our scheme achieved a 95.3% human accuracy, a 6.7.

%X IT security systems often attempt to support users in taking a decision by
communicating associated risks. However, a lack of efficacy as well as problems
with habituation in such systems are well known issues. In this paper, we
propose to leverage the rich set of personal data available on smartphones to
communicate risks using personalized examples. Examples of private information
that may be at risk can draw the users' attention to relevant information for a
decision and also improve their response. We present two experiments that
validate this approach in the context of Android app permissions. Private
information that becomes accessible given certain permissions is displayed when
a user wants to install an app, demonstrating the consequences this
installation might have. We find that participants made more privacy-conscious
choices when deciding which apps to install. Additionally, our results show
that our approach causes a negative affect in participants, which makes them
pay more attention.

Recent years have brought a rash of high-profile account compromises, but
account hijacking is not limited to high-profile accounts. In this paper, we
report results of a survey about people's experiences with and attitudes toward
account hijacking. The problem is widespread; 30% of our 294 participants had
an email or social networking account accessed by an unauthorized party. Five
themes emerged from our results: (1) compromised accounts are often valuable to
victims, (2) attackers are mostly unknown, but sometimes known, to victims, (3)
users acknowledge some responsibility for keeping their accounts secure, (4)
users' understanding of important security measures is incomplete, and (5) harm
from account hijacking is concrete and emotional. We discuss implications for
designing security mechanisms to improve chances for user adoption.

factors, we ran six experimental SSL warnings in Google Chrome 29 and measured

protection mechanisms. However, users do not always choose to install updates.
Through interviewing non-expert Windows users, we found that users frequently
decide not to install future updates, regardless of whether they are important
for security, after negative experiences with past updates. This means that
even non-security updates (such as user interface changes) can impact the
security of a computer. We discuss three themes impacting users' willingness to

assessing whether an update is 'worth it', and confusion about why an update is

of projects that have been successful in the long-term. In this paper we
investigate what factors are important for developing long lasting community
ICT interventions. We do this by analysing a successful action research project
and provide five recommendations for facilitating sustained community
engagement. CrowdMemo aimed to preserve local heritage in a town in rural
Argentina and the project was set up so that it could be continued by the
community once researchers had left. Participants created videos about personal
memories of the town and over 600 people attended the premiere where they were
first screened. The impact has not just been short-term and there has been
sustained engagement with the project by stakeholders in the town and wider
region: the local school integrated digital storytelling into its curriculum;
the approach has been adopted by two nearby towns; and the project has
influenced regional government educational policy.

%X Cultural institutions, such as museums, often curate politically and
ethically sensitive materials. Increasingly, Internet-enabled, digital
technology intersects with these curatorial practices offering new
opportunities for public and scholarly engagement. We report on a case study of
human rights media archiving at a genocide memorial centre in Rwanda, motivated
by our interests in ICT support to memorialisation practices. Through an
analysis of our discussions with staff about their work, we report on how
accounts of the Rwandan Genocide are being captured and curated to support the
centre's humanitarian agenda and associated values. We identify transferable
curatorial concerns for human rights media communication amongst scholarly
networks and public audiences worldwide, elucidating interaction design
challenges for supportive ICT and contributing to HCI discourses on Value
Sensitive Design and cultural engagement with sensitive materials.

%X Public sexual harassment has emerged as a large and growing concern in urban
Bangladesh, with deep and damaging implications for gender security, justice,
and rights of public participation. In this paper we describe an integrated
program of ethnographic and design work meant to understand and address such
problems. For one year we conducted surveys, interviews, and focus groups
around sexual harassment with women at three different universities in Dhaka.
Based on this input, we developed "Protibadi", a web and mobile phone based
application designed to report, map, and share women's stories around sexual
harassment in public places. In August 2013 the system launched, user studies
were conducted, and public responses were monitored to gauge reactions,
strengths, and limits of the system. This paper describes the findings of our
ethnographic and design-based work, and suggests lessons relevant to other HCI
efforts to understand and design around difficult and culturally sensitive
problems.

related interventions have aimed to incorporate marginalized communities
towards global economic growth. Our work builds on this. We present results
from an exploratory qualitative study on the family communication practices of
family members who communicate both within and between rural, suburban, and
urban settings in Kenya. Our findings reveal that family communication focuses
on economic support, well-being, life advice, and everyday coordination of
activities. We also outline social factors that affect family communication,
including being an eldest child, having a widowed sibling, and having reduced
access to technology because of gender, literacy, or one's financial situation.
Lastly, we discuss new opportunities for technology design and articulate the
challenges that designers will face if creating or deploying family
communication technologies in Kenya.

site based on a crowd of volunteers with a standard operator-based help desk,
ensuring quality of customer service. Q&amp;A sites have emerged as an
efficient way to address questions in various domains by leveraging crowd
knowledge. However, they lack sufficient reliability to be the sole basis of
customer service applications. We built a proof-of-concept mixed-initiative
tool that helps a crowd-manager to decide if a question will get a satisfactory
and timely answer by the crowd or if it should be redirected to a dedicated
operator. A user experiment found that our tool reduced the participants'
cognitive load and improved their performance, in terms of their precision and
recall. In particular, those with higher performance benefited more than those
with lower performance.

%X Every day users of social networking services ask their followers and
friends millions of questions. These friendsourced questions not only provide
informational benefits, but also may reinforce social bonds. However, there is
a limit to how much a person may want to friendsource. They may be
uncomfortable asking questions that are too private, might not want to expend
others' time or effort, or may feel as though they have already accrued too
many social debts. These perceived social costs limit the potential benefits of
friendsourcing. In this paper we explore the perceived social costs of
friendsourcing on Twitter via a monetary choice. We develop a model of how
users value the attention and effort of their social network while
friendsourcing, compare and contrast it with paid question answering in a
crowdsourced labor market, and provide future design considerations for better
supporting friendsourcing.

%X We studied how a source expertise indicator impacted users' information
seeking behavior when using a system aggregating diverse opinions, and how it
interacted with a source position indicator to shape users' selectivity of
information. We found that, for both attitude consistent and inconsistent
information, the expertise indicator increased the selection of sources
indicated to have high expertise and decreased that of low expertise. Moreover,
when both source expertise and position indicators were present, users'
selective exposure tendency, i.e., preferential selection of attitude
consistent sources over inconsistent ones, decreased among expert sources.
Moreover, we found that the expertise indicator could benefit encouraging
common ground seeking with different others by increasing the agreement with,
and perceived expertise of inconsistent sources indicated to be experts. Design
implications for moderating selective exposure by highlighting the utility of
dissonant information were discussed.

questions that seek various types of subjective and objective information.
These questions are often labeled with 'Q&amp;A' hashtags, such as #lazyweb or
#twoogle. We surveyed Twitter users and found they employ these Q&amp;A
hashtags both as a topical signifier (this tweet needs an answer!) and to reach
out to those beyond their immediate followers (a community of helpful tweeters
who monitor the hashtag). However, our log analysis of thousands of hashtagged
Q&amp;A exchanges reveals that nearly all replies to hashtagged questions come
from a user's immediate follower network, contradicting users' beliefs that
they are tapping into a larger community by tagging their question tweets. This
finding has implications for designing next-generation social search systems
that reach and engage a wide audience of answerers.

%X Consumer product reviews are the backbone of commerce online. Most commonly,
sites ask users for their personal opinions on a product or service. I
conjecture, however, that this traditional method of eliciting reviews often
invites idiosyncratic viewpoints. In this paper, I present a statistical study
examining the differences between traditionally elicited product ratings (i.e.,
"How do you rate this product'") and social inference ratings (i.e., "How do
you think other people will rate this product'"). In 5 of 6 trials, I find that
social inference ratings produce the same aggregate product rating as the one
produced via traditionally elicited ratings. In all cases, however, social
inferences yield less variance. This is significant because using social
inference ratings 1) therefore converges on the true aggregate product rating
faster, and 2) is a cheap design intervention on the part of existing sites.

%X Wall-sized displays can support data visualization and collaboration, but
making them interactive is challenging. Smarties allows wall application
developers to easily add interactive support to their collaborative
applications. It consists of an interface running on touch mobile devices for
input, a communication protocol between devices and the wall, and a library
that implements the protocol and handles synchronization, locking and input
conflicts. The library presents the input as an event loop with callback
functions. Each touch mobile has multiple cursor controllers, each associated
with keyboards, widgets and clipboards. These controllers can be assigned to
specific tasks, are persistent in nature, and can be shared by multiple
collaborating users for sharing work. They can control simple cursors on the
wall application, or specific content (objects or groups of them). The types of
associated widgets are decided by the wall application, making the mobile
interface customizable by the wall application it connects to.

also present a cross-device usage scenario which utilizes several cross-device
applications built within our prototype framework. We also describe a user
study, which helped us to understand how users will take advantage of a large

%X Current GUI builders provide a design environment for user interfaces that
target either a single type or fixed set of devices, and provide little support
for scenarios in which the user interface, or parts of it, are distributed over
multiple devices. Distributed user interfaces have received increasing
attention over the past years. There are different, often model-based,
approaches that focus on technical issues. This paper presents XDStudio -- a
new GUI builder designed to support interactive development of cross-device web
interfaces. XDStudio implements two complementary authoring modes with a focus
on the design process of distributed user interfaces. First, simulated
authoring allows designing for a multi-device environment on a single device by
simulating other target devices. Second, on-device authoring allows the design
process itself to be distributed over multiple devices, as design and
development take place on the target devices themselves. To support interactive
development for multi-device environments, where not all devices may be present
at design and run-time, XDStudio supports switching between the two authoring
modes, as well as between design and use modes, as required. This paper focuses
on the design of XDStudio, and evaluates its support for two distribution
scenarios.

%X Physical activity is important for improving quality of life in people with
chronic pain. However, actual or anticipated pain exacerbation, and lack of
confidence when doing physical activity, make it difficult to maintain and
build towards long-term activity goals. Research guiding the design of
interactive technology to motivate and support physical activity in people with
chronic pain is lacking. We conducted studies with: (1) people with chronic
pain, to understand how they maintained and increased physical activity in
daily life and what factors deterred them; and (2) pain-specialist
physiotherapists, to understand how they supported people with chronic pain.
Building on this understanding, we investigated the use of auditory feedback to
address some of the psychological barriers and needs identified and to increase
self-efficacy, motivation and confidence in physical activity. We conclude by
discussing further design opportunities based on the overall findings.

%X Rehabilitation has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of falling in
older adults. However, low adherence to rehabilitation exercises in the home
means that seniors often do not get the therapy that they require. We propose
that the use of tailored exergames could encourage adherence to falls
rehabilitation in the home, as exergames have proved successful in clinical
settings. We describe the results from the first known study to investigate the
long-term (12 weeks) use of exergames, designed in close collaboration with
elderly users, for falls rehabilitation in the home. Our findings suggest that
there is an untapped potential of exergames for home rehabilitation use, as our
findings show that there was better adherence to exercise in participants who
used the exergames, versus those who used standard care. Finally, we make
recommendations for designers, on the design of exergames for the
rehabilitation of seniors.

%X Computer-supported fitness interventions for adolescents have the potential
to improve adolescents' attitudes and perceptions about physical activity
through peer influence and interpersonal accountability. Past research has
explored the potential of interventions based on competition and
social-comparison mechanisms. We present a new approach: school-based,
pervasive social fitness systems. We describe one such system: StepStream, a
pedometer-based microblog we designed and deployed for four weeks with 42 US
middle school students. StepStream users improved their attitudes about fitness
and increased their sense of social support for fitness. The least-active
students also increased their daily activity. We show that our school-based
social fitness approach performed comparably in attitude and behavior change to
more competitive or direct-comparison systems. These results expand the
strategies available computer-supported fitness interventions. Our school-based
social fitness approach to everyday adolescent health shows the potential for
social computing systems to positively influence offline health behaviors in
real-world settings.

%X Group exercise has multiple benefits including greater adherence to fitness
regimens, increased enjoyment among participants, and enhanced workout
intensity. While a large number of technology tools have emerged to support
real-time feedback of individual performance, tools to support group fitness
are limited. In this paper, we present a set of wearable e-textile displays for
running groups called Social Fabric Fitness (SFF). SFF provides a glanceable,
shared screen on the back of the wearer's shirt to increase awareness and
motivation of group fitness performance. We discuss parallel prototyping of
three designs-one flexible e-ink and two flexible LED-based displays; the
selection and refinement of one design; and two evaluations'a field study of 10
running groups and two case studies of running races. Our qualitative findings
indicate that SFF improves awareness of individual and group performance, helps
groups stay together, and improves in-situ motivation. We close with
reflections for future athletic e-textile displays.

therefore investigated the experience of smell and the emotions that accompany
it. We collected stories from 439 participants who described personally
memorable smell experiences in an online questionnaire. Based on the stories we
developed 10 categories of smell experience. We explored the implications of
the categories for smell-enhanced technology design by (a) probing participants
to envision technologies that match their smell story and (b) having HCI
researchers brainstorm technologies using the categories as design stimuli. We
discuss how our findings can benefit research on personal memories, momentary

basic tastes elicit. These findings are discussed on the basis of established

%X We present SensaBubble, a chrono-sensory mid-air display system that
generates scented bubbles to deliver information to the user via a number of
sensory modalities. The system reliably produces single bubbles of specific
sizes along a directed path. Each bubble produced by SensaBubble is filled with
fog containing a scent relevant to the notification. The chrono-sensory aspect
of SensaBubble means that information is presented both temporally and
multimodally. Temporal information is enabled through two forms of persistence:
firstly, a visual display projected onto the bubble which only endures until it
bursts; secondly, a scent released upon the bursting of the bubble slowly
disperses and leaves a longer-lasting perceptible trace of the event. We report
details of SensaBubble's design and implementation, as well as results of
technical and user evaluations. We then discuss and demonstrate how SensaBubble
can be adapted for use in a wide range of application contexts -- from an
ambient peripheral display for persistent alerts, to an engaging display for
gaming or education.

message carrier (a.k.a., food messaging). To investigate how people accept,
use, and perceive food messaging, we conducted exploratory interviews, a field
study, and follow-up interviews over four weeks in a large information
technology (IT) company. We collected 904 messages sent by 343 users. Our
results suggest strong acceptance of food messaging as an alternative message
channel. Further analysis implies that food messaging embodies characteristics
of both text messaging and gifting. It is preferred in close relationships for
its evocation of positive emotions. As the first field study on edible social
messaging, our empirical findings provide valuable insights into the uniqueness
of food as a message carrier and its capabilities to promote greater social
bonding.

random ones. In response to the logical posture-language structure, people
adapted to logical memorization strategies, such as 'exclusion', 'order', and
'category', to minimize the amount of information to retain. We conclude that
structured chord-command mappings support learning, short-, and long-term
retention of chord-command mappings.

%X Substantial amount of research in Psychology has studied how people
manipulate objects in the physical world. This work has unveiled that people
show strong signs of prospective motor planning, i.e., they choose initial
grasps that avoid uncomfortable end postures and facilitate object
manipulation. Interactive tabletops allow their users great flexibility in the
manipulation of virtual objects but to our knowledge previous work has never
examined whether prospective motor control takes place in this context. To test
this, we ran three experiments. We systematically studied how users adapt their
grasp when asked to translate and rotate virtual objects on a multitouch
tabletop. Our results demonstrate that target position and orientation
significantly affect the orientation of finger placement on the object. We
analyze our results in the light of the most recent model of planning for
manipulating physical objects and identify their implications for the design of
tabletop interfaces.

%X Over the past decade, multi-touch surfaces have become commonplace, with
many researchers and practitioners describing the benefits of their natural,
physical-like interactions. We present a pair of studies that empirically
investigates the psychophysical effects of direct interaction with both
physical and virtual artefacts. We use the phenomenon of Kinesthetic Figural
After Effects-a change in understanding of the physical size of an object after
a period of exposure to an object of different size. Our studies show that,
while this effect is robustly reproducible when using physical artefacts, this
same effect does not manifest when manipulating virtual artefacts on a direct,
multi-touch tabletop display. We contribute quantitative evidence suggesting a
psychophysical difference in our response to physical vs. virtual objects, and
discuss future research directions to explore measurable phenomena to evaluate
the presence of physical-like changes from virtual on-screen objects.

%X The average person can skillfully manipulate a plethora of tools, from
hammers to tweezers. However, despite this remarkable dexterity, gestures on
today's touch devices are simplistic, relying primarily on the chording of
fingers: one-finger pan, two-finger pinch, four-finger swipe and similar. We
propose that touch gesture design be inspired by the manipulation of physical
tools from the real world. In this way, we can leverage user familiarity and
fluency with such tools to build a rich set of gestures for touch interaction.
With only a few minutes of training on a proof-of-concept system, users were
able to summon a variety of virtual tools by replicating their corresponding
real-world grasps.

%X People find it difficult to remember multiple alphanumeric as well as
graphical passwords. We propose a Passhint authentication system (PHAS), where
the users have to choose four images and create hints for each one of them in
order to register a new password. During authentication, they have to recognize
only the target images, which are displayed with their corresponding hints,
among collections of 15 decoy images, in a four step process. A usability study
was conducted with 40 subjects. They created 1 Mikon, 1 doodle, 1 art and 1
object password and then recalled each password after a period of two weeks
(without any practice sessions). The results demonstrated that the memorability
of multiple passwords in PHAS is better than in existing Graphical
authentication systems (GASs). Although the registration time is high,
authentication time for successful attempts is either equivalent to or less
than the time reported for previous GASs. A guessability study conducted with
the same subjects revealed that art passwords are the least guessable, followed
by Mikon, doodle and objects in that order. The results strongly suggest the
use of art passwords in PHAS, which would offer usable as well as secure
authentication. The preliminary results indicate that PHAS has solved the
memorability problem with multiple passwords. We propose two new features that
could enhance the security offered by PHAS, but the usability of these features
would need to be tested before they could be adopted in practice.

%X To encourage strong passwords, system administrators employ
password-composition policies, such as a traditional policy requiring that
passwords have at least 8 characters from 4 character classes and pass a
dictionary check. Recent research has suggested, however, that policies
requiring longer passwords with fewer additional requirements can be more
usable and in some cases more secure than this traditional policy. To explore
long passwords in more detail, we conducted an online experiment with 8,143
participants. Using a cracking algorithm modified for longer passwords, we
evaluate eight policies across a variety of metrics for strength and usability.
Among the longer policies, we discover new evidence for a security/usability
tradeoff, with none being strictly better than another on both dimensions.
However, several policies are both more usable and more secure that the
traditional policy we tested. Our analyses additionally reveal common patterns
and strings found in cracked passwords. We discuss how system administrators
can use these results to improve password-composition policies.

to a graphical password interface can modify the distribution of user chosen
passwords, and thus possibly the security it provides. The only change to the
interface is how the background image is presented to the user in the password
creation phase -- we call the effect of this change the "presentation effect".
We demonstrate the presentation effect by performing a comparative user study
of two groups using the same background image, where the image is presented in
two different ways prior to password creation. Our results show a statistically
different distribution of user's graphical passwords, with no observed
usability consequences.

%X Gesture typing is a popular text input method used on smartphones. Gesture
keyboards are based on word gestures that subsequently trace all letters of a
word on a virtual keyboard. Instead of tapping a word key by key, the user
enters a word gesture with a single continuous stroke. In this paper, we
introduce an implicit user verification approach for short text messages that
are entered with a gesture keyboard. We utilize the way people interact with
gesture keyboards to extract behavioral biometric features. We propose a
proof-of-concept classification framework that learns the gesture typing
behavior of a person and is able to decide whether a gestured message was
written by the legitimate user or an imposter. Data collected from gesture
keyboard users in a user study is used to assess the performance of the
classification framework, demonstrating that the technique has considerable
promise.

the epistemological and ethical positions involved in designing for prosocial
outcomes as well as how HCI researchers posit economic decision-making.
Finally, emerging issues and opportunities for further debate and collaboration

lays out the complexities involved in achieving responsible design. In order to
do this we will first compare an emerging policy-oriented programme of research
known as RRI (Responsible Research and Innovation) with initiatives in HCI. A
focus on the similarities and differences may highlight to what extent
responsibility is already and successfully embedded within the concerns and
practices of design and use, and what may yet need to be incorporated for
responsible design. The paper then discusses the challenges of 'naturalising'
the very ambitious programme of RRI within specific design activities and
concerns, through the lens of four analytic concepts: reflexivity;
responsiveness; inclusion; and anticipation. Finally, we make a case for a
pragmatic, 'unromantic', but engaged reinterpretation of RRI for HCI.

lagging behind. We conducted a field study of the most prominent of these,
timebanking; a system in which 'time dollars' are earned and spent by people
providing services for and receiving them from each other. Our study exposed
problems with the very metaphor of banking itself, which deter participation.
In this paper we discuss how these problems can be tackled with user experience
design for systems supporting timebanking. Our design ideas emphasize the
personal and social benefits of participation, and avoid such unappealing
concepts as debt and neediness that the timebanking metaphor falls afoul of.

motivations and contribution. Whilst high contributors were deeply engaged by
social or competitive features, low contributors described a solitary
experience of 'dabbling' in projects for short periods. Since the majority of
participants exhibit this small-scale contribution pattern, there is great
potential value in designing interfaces to tempt lone workers to complete 'just
another page', or to lure early drop-outs back into participation. This
includes breaking the work into components which can be tackled without a major
commitment of time and effort, and providing feedback on the quality and value
of these contributions.

insight journalism, we present two case studies of community technologies that
were directly inspired, informed and evaluated by journalistic content. Based
on this experience, we evaluate the role that insight journalism can play in
designing for communities, the particular characteristics that it lends to the
design process and how it might be employed to support sustainable community
innovation.

NewsViews system leverages text mining to identify key concepts and locations
discussed in articles (as well as potential annotations), an extensive
repository of 'found' databases, and techniques adapted from cartography to
identify and create visually 'interesting' thematic maps. In this work, we
develop and evaluate key criteria in automatic, annotated, map generation and
experimentally validate the key features for successful representations (e.g.,
relevance to context, variable selection, 'interestingness' of representation
and annotation quality).

logged digital activity and continually probed perspectives of 32 information
workers for five days in situ to understand how attentional states change with
context. We present a framework of how engagement and challenge in work relate

boredom in the workplace. Focus peaks mid-afternoon while boredom is highest in
early afternoon. People are happiest doing rote work and most stressed doing
focused work. On Mondays people are most bored but also most focused. Online
activities are associated with different attentional states, showing different
patterns at beginning and end of day, and before and after a mid-day break. Our
study shows how rhythms of attentional states are associated with context and

%X Interruptions can have a significant impact on users working to complete a
task. When people are collaborating, either with other users or with systems,
coordinating interruptions is an important factor in maintaining efficiency and
preventing information overload. Computer systems can observe user behavior,
model it, and use this to optimize the interruptions to minimize disruption.
However, current techniques often require long training periods that make them
unsuitable for online collaborative environments where new users frequently
participate.
   In this paper, we present a novel synthesis between Collaborative Filtering
methods and machine learning classification algorithms to create a fast
learning algorithm, CRISP. CRISP exploits the similarities between users in
order to apply data from known users to new users, therefore requiring less
information on each person. Results from user studies indicate the algorithm
significantly improves users' performances in completing the task and their
perception of how long it took to complete each task.

%X Mobile phones have evolved significantly in recent years from single-purpose
communication devices to multi-purpose computing devices. Despite this
evolution, the interaction model for how incoming calls are handled has barely
changed. Current-generation smartphones still use abrupt full-screen
notifications to alert users to incoming calls, demanding a decision to either
accept or decline the call. These full-screen notifications forcibly interrupt
whatever activity the user was already engaged in. This might be undesirable
when the user's primary task was more important than the incoming call. This
paper explores the design space for how smartphones can alert users to incoming
calls. We consider designs that allow users to postpone calls and also to
multiplex by way of a smaller partial-screen notification. These design
alternatives were evaluated in both a small-scale controlled lab study as well
as a large-scale naturalistic in-the-wild study. Results show that a multiplex
design solution works best because it allows people to continue working on
their primary task while being made aware that there is a caller on the line.
The contribution of this work is an enhanced interaction design for handling
phone calls, and an understanding of how people use it for handling incoming
calls.

%X Notifications are a core feature of mobile phones. They inform users about a
variety of events. Users may take immediate action or ignore them depending on
the importance of a notification as well as their current context. The nature
of notifications is manifold, applications use them both sparsely and
frequently. In this paper we present the first large-scale analysis of mobile
notifications with a focus on users' subjective perceptions. We derive a
holistic picture of notifications on mobile phones by collecting close to 200
million notifications from more than 40,000 users. Using a data-driven
approach, we break down what users like and dislike about notifications. Our
results reveal differences in importance of notifications and how users value
notifications from messaging apps as well as notifications that include
information about people and events. Based on these results we derive a number
of findings about the nature of notifications and guidelines to effectively use
them.

the act of customizing a DSS can lead to biased decision making. I show that
users who believe they have customized a DSS's recommendation algorithm are
more likely to follow the recommendations regardless of their accuracy. I also

learning systems, but is actually fraught with problems. This paper introduces
the notion of concept evolution, the changing nature of a person's underlying
concept (the abstract notion of the target class a person is labeling for,
e.g., spam email, travel related web pages) which can result in inconsistent
labels and thus be detrimental to machine learning. We introduce two structured
labeling solutions, a novel technique we propose for helping people define and
refine their concept in a consistent manner as they label. Through a series of
five experiments, including a controlled lab study, we illustrate the impact
and dynamics of concept evolution in practice and show that structured labeling
helps people label more consistently in the presence of concept evolution than
traditional labeling.

%X We present an approach to interactive recommending that combines the
advantages of algorithmic techniques with the benefits of user-controlled,
interactive exploration in a novel manner. The method extracts latent factors
from a matrix of user rating data as commonly used in Collaborative Filtering,
and generates dialogs in which the user iteratively chooses between two sets of
sample items. Samples are chosen by the system for low and high values of each
latent factor considered. The method positions the user in the latent factor
space with few interaction steps, and finally selects items near the user
position as recommendations.
   In a user study, we compare the system with three alternative approaches
including manual search and automatic recommending. The results show
significant advantages of our approach over the three competing alternatives in
15 out of 24 possible parameter comparisons, in particular with respect to item
fit, interaction effort and user control. The findings corroborate our
assumption that the proposed method achieves a good trade-off between automated
and interactive functions in recommender systems.

%X Activity recognition can provide computers with the context underlying user
inputs, enabling more relevant responses and more fluid interaction. However,
training these systems is difficult because it requires observing every
possible sequence of actions that comprise a given activity. Prior work has
enabled the crowd to provide labels in real-time to train automated systems
on-the-fly, but numerous examples are still needed before the system can
recognize an activity on its own. To reduce the need to collect this data by
observing users, we introduce ARchitect, a system that uses the crowd to
capture the dependency structure of the actions that make up activities. Our
tests show that over seven times as many examples can be collected using our
approach versus relying on direct observation alone, demonstrating that by
leveraging the understanding of the crowd, it is possible to more easily train
automated systems.

algorithm that exploits correlation, hierarchy, and sparsity of the label
distribution. A case study of labeling 200 objects using 20,000 images
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. The algorithm results in up to
6x reduction in human computation time compared to the naive method of querying
a human annotator for the presence of every object in every image.

%X Power wheelchair users often use and carry multiple mobile computing
devices. Many power wheelchair users have some upper body motor impairment that
can make using these devices difficult. We believe that mobile device
accessibility could be improved through designs that take into account users'
functional abilities and take advantage of available space around the
wheelchair itself. In this paper we present findings from multiple design
sessions and interviews with 13 power wheelchair users and 30 clinicians,
exploring the placement and form factor possibilities for input and output on a
power wheelchair. We found that many power wheelchair users could benefit from
chairable technology that is designed to work within the workspace of the
wheelchair, whether worn on the body or mounted on he wheelchair frame. We
present participants' preferences for chairable input and output devices, and
identify possible design configurations for wearable and chairable devices.

%X Smartphone apps can use object recognition software to provide information
to blind or low vision users about objects in the visual environment. A crucial
challenge for these users is aiming the camera properly to take a well-framed
picture of the desired target object. We investigate the effects of two
fundamental constraints of object recognition -- frame rate and camera field of
view -- on a blind person's ability to use an object recognition smartphone
app. The app was used by 18 blind participants to find visual targets beyond
arm's reach and approach them to within 30 cm. While we expected that a faster
frame rate or wider camera field of view should always improve search
performance, our experimental results show that in many cases increasing the
field of view does not help, and may even hurt, performance. These results have
important implications for the design of object recognition systems for blind
users.

%X With the increasing popularity of mainstream wearable devices, it is
critical to assess the accessibility implications of such technologies. For
people with visual impairments, who do not always need the visual display of a
mobile phone, alternative means of eyes-free wearable interaction are
particularly appealing. To explore the potential impacts of such technology, we
conducted two studies. The first was an online survey that included 114
participants with visual impairments and 101 sighted participants; we compare
the two groups in terms of current device use. The second was an interview and
design probe study with 10 participants with visual impairments. Our findings
expand on past work to characterize a range of trends in smartphone use and
accessibility issues therein. Participants with visual impairments also
responded positively to two eyes-free wearable device scenarios: a wristband or
ring and a glasses-based device. Discussions on projected use of these devices
suggest that small, easily accessible, and discreet wearable input could
positively impact the ability of people with visual impairments to access
information on the go and to participate in certain social interactions.

visually impaired people use online social networks, specifically Facebook. We
identify a sample of 50K visually impaired users, and study the activities they
perform, the content they produce, and the friendship networks they build on
Facebook. We find that visually impaired users participate on Facebook (e.g.
status updates, comments, likes) as much as the general population, and receive
more feedback (i.e., comments and likes) on average on their content. By
analyzing the content produced by visually impaired users, we find that they
share their experience and issues related to vision impairment. We also
identify distinctive patterns in their language and technology use. We also
show that, compared to other users, visually impaired users have smaller social
networks, but such differences have decreased over time. Our findings have
implications for improving the utility and usability of online social networks
for visually impaired users.

%X We introduce the concept of tangibles that users can manipulate with their
feet. We call them kickables. Unlike traditional tangibles, kickables allow for
very large interaction surfaces as kickables reside on the ground. The main
benefit of kickables over other foot-based modalities, such as foot touch, is
their strong affordance, which we validate in two user studies. This affordance
makes kickables well-suited for walk-up installations, such as tradeshows or
museum exhibits.
   We present a custom design as well as five families of standard kickables to
help application designers create kickable applications faster. Each family
supports multiple standard controls, such as push buttons, switches, dials, and
sliders. Each type explores a different design principle, in particular
different mechanical constraints. We demonstrate an implementation on our
pressure-sensing floor.

design, GaussBricks, which enables real-time constructive tangible interactions
on portable displays. Given its simplicity, the mechanical design of the
magnetic building blocks facilitates the construction of configurable forms.
The form constructed by the magnetic building blocks, which are connected by
the magnetic joints, allows users to stably manipulate with various elastic
force feedback mechanisms. With an analog Hall-sensor grid mounted to its back,
a portable display determines the geometrical configuration and detects various
user interactions in real time. This work also introduce several methods to
enable shape changing, multi-touch input, and display capabilities in the
construction. The proposed building block system enriches how individuals
interact with the portable displays physically.

and the design process. We present the technical limitations encountered during
game development and analyze video recordings of play sessions with regard to
the play strategies developed by the players. Then, we identify two properties
that this game shares with many other games on tangible platforms and discuss
how these properties influence both the game design process and the player
experience. We advocate that these properties provide players with more freedom
and relatedness, while helping to create an easy-to-learn and customizable
gameplay, despite their own design limitations.

the receivers to 3D positions. We demonstrate non-contact motion gestures, and
precise 3D hand and finger localization. We conclude by discussing limitations
and future work.

evaluation, we compare our design against two baseline interfaces for switching
between everyday mobile applications. This comparison highlights the
deficiencies of current view-fixed displays, as the Personal Cockpit provides a
40% improvement in application switching time. We demonstrate of several useful

%X We propose the use of Hand-to-Face input, a method to interact with
head-worn displays (HWDs) that involves contact with the face. We explore
Hand-to-Face interaction to find suitable techniques for common mobile tasks.
We evaluate this form of interaction with document navigation tasks and examine
its social acceptability. In a first study, users identify the cheek and
forehead as predominant areas for interaction and agree on gestures for tasks
involving continuous input, such as document navigation. These results guide
the design of several Hand-to-Face navigation techniques and reveal that
gestures performed on the cheek are more efficient and less tiring than
interactions directly on the HWD. Initial results on the social acceptability
of Hand-to-Face input allow us to further refine our design choices, and reveal
unforeseen results: some gestures are considered culturally inappropriate and
gender plays a role in selection of specific Hand-to-Face interactions. From
our overall results, we provide a set of guidelines for developing effective
Hand-to-Face interaction techniques.

techniques for multi-view tabletops to support co-located collaboration across
a wide variety of collaborative coupling styles. These techniques (1) provide
support both for group work and for individual work, as well as for the
transitions in-between, (2) contribute sharing and peeking techniques to
support mutual awareness and group coordination during phases of individual
work, (3) reduce interference during group work on a group view, and (4)
directly integrate with conventional multi-touch input. We illustrate our
techniques in a proof-of-concept implementation with the two example
applications of map navigation and photo collages. Results from two user
studies demonstrate that Permulin supports fluent transitions between
individual and group work and exhibits unique awareness properties that allow
participants to be highly aware of each other during tightly coupled
collaboration, while being able to unobtrusively perform individual work during
loosely coupled collaboration.

%X One unique property of head-mounted displays (HMDs) is that content can
easily be displayed at a fixed position within the user's field of view
(head-stabilized). This ensures that critical information (e.g. warnings) is
continuously visible and can, in principle, be perceived as quickly as
possible. We examined this strategy with a physically and visually distracted
driver. We ran two consecutive studies in a driving simulator, comparing
different warning visualizations in a head-up display (HUD) and a HMD. In an
initial study, we found no significant effects of warning type or display
technology on the reaction times. In a second study, after modifying our
visualization to include a visual reference marker, we found that with only
this minor change, reaction times were significantly lower in the HMD when
compared to the HUD. Our insights can help others design better head-stabilized
notifications.

computer-mediated communication (CMC) is the availability of visual cues. It is
often assumed that the reduction of visibility in audio and video conferencing
may negatively impact the use of gesture to communicate, and thus negatively
influence other outcomes. In this paper we "Kinect-taped" F2F and CMC
communication in brainstorming groups by using motion sensors to record and
analyze group members' hand movements during communication. We investigate how
different media influence gesture use and gestural similarity, and how the use
of gesture associates with level of understanding and brainstorming
performance. Implications to future research and design are discussed.

%X Motion-capture-based biomechanical simulation is a non-invasive analysis
method that yields a rich description of posture, joint, and muscle activity in
human movement. The method is presently gaining ground in sports, medicine, and
industrial ergonomics, but it also bears great potential for studies in HCI
where the physical ergonomics of a design is important. To make the method more
broadly accessible, we study its predictive validity for movements and users
typical to studies in HCI. We discuss the sources of error in biomechanical
simulation and present results from two validation studies conducted with a
state-of-the-art system. Study I tested aimed movements ranging from multitouch
gestures to dancing, finding out that the critical limiting factor is the size
of movement. Study II compared muscle activation predictions to surface-EMG
recordings in a 3D pointing task. The data shows medium-to-high validity that
is, however, constrained by some characteristics of the movement and the user.
We draw concrete recommendations to practitioners and discuss challenges to
developing the method further.

on running and walking, these devices offer limited functionality for
strength-training exercises. We introduce RecoFit, a system for automatically
tracking repetitive exercises -- such as weight training and calisthenics --
via an arm-worn inertial sensor. Our goal is to provide real-time and
post-workout feedback, with no user-specific training and no intervention
during a workout. Toward this end, we address three challenges: (1) segmenting
exercise from intermittent non-exercise periods, (2) recognizing which exercise
is being performed, and (3) counting repetitions. We present cross-validation
results on our training data and results from a study assessing the final
system, totaling 114 participants over 146 sessions. We achieve precision and
recall greater than 95% in identifying exercise periods, recognition of 99%,
98%, and 96% on circuits of 4, 7, and 13 exercises respectively, and counting
that is accurate to &plusmn;1 repetition 93% of the time. These results suggest
that our approach enables a new category of fitness tracking devices.

world scene description tasks. Given a visual scene, the system dynamically
biases its language model based on the content of the visual scene and visual
attention of the speaker. Visual attention is used to focus on likely objects
within the scene. Given a spoken description the system then uses the visually
biased language model to process the speech. The system uses head pose as a
proxy for the visual attention of the speaker. Readily available standard
computer vision algorithms are used to recognize the objects in the scene and
automatic real time head pose estimation is done using depth data captured via
a Microsoft Kinect. The system was evaluated on multiple participants. Overall,
incorporating visual information into the speech recognizer greatly improved
speech recognition accuracy. The rapidly decreasing cost of 3D sensing
technologies such as the Kinect allows systems with similar underlying
principles to be used for many speech recognition tasks where there is visual
information.

communities. Our insights are useful for the public interaction design of
future urban, interactive networks that aim to positively influence community
participation and social cohesion.

%X Increasing amounts of geo-tagged social media have led to interest in how
that media can be re-integrated into the physical environment. Yet, although
location information is often automatically appended to media, little is know
about how users consider location in its creation and viewing. Using Graffiti
as a design meme, we developed a novel social media service to investigate
these issues. A two week field study showed how users incorporated both
utilitarian and playful aspects of location into their social media creation,
as well as revealing a disconnect between the location-media relationship
intended by creators and perceived by viewers. We outline implications of our
work for services that seek to repurpose existing geo-tagged social media in
the design of novel services.

%X Social media and online social networks dramatically change the way in which
knowledge is acquired and disseminated. How do we re-understand about human
knowledge and knowing? This work aims at extending the current understanding of
human epistemic cognition in online social environments, where epistemic
cognition refers to cognitions and cognitive processes related to epistemic
matters such as knowledge and beliefs justification. We approach our inquiry
with mixed methods: (1) quantitative study to test whether epistemic cognition
might differ in individual and social contexts, and whether online interactions
might mediate the later; and (2) social cognitive task analysis with interviews
to manifest the intricate interplay of dynamics between social epistemic
cognition and online interactions. We introduce the new construct of social
epistemic cognition and contribute to the field of HCI with an evolved theory
which states that epistemic cognition can be promoted in online social
environments as mediated by online interactions.

%X Collaborative online shopping, an emerging paradigm in e-commerce, allows
remote shoppers to extend purchase-oriented social interactions into the
digital environment. Online vendors have been experimenting ways to facilitate
this activity. However, more research needs to be done on identifying what
feature can create a pleasing shopping experience and ultimately encourage
spending. In this paper, we present an exploration of the impact of
co-navigation supports, including location cue, split screen, and shared view,
on the experiences and performance of 60 co-shopper dyads. We also studied if
status composition of shopping companions played a role in this process. By
analyzing about 1800 minutes of eye-tracking data, video footages, and web
logs, we found that split screen encouraged more diverse product search, shared
view enabled better coordination, and location cue was the least distracting.
Co-buyers achieved better factual and inference understanding, though
buyer-advisor dyads were more likely to stay together.

%X A poor nutritional state, as is the case for many people today, can increase
risks for cancer, cardiovascular disease and obesity. Technology supported
approaches could potentially be used to positively influence food consumption.
We present the Nutriflect system, which utilizes users' shopping data to inform
them about their long term shopping behavior. In an initial study we conducted
structured interviews in grocery stores. Based on the results we implemented a
system that visualized a household's collective shopping information via
situated displays. The aim was to raise awareness about shopping habits and to
enable reflection about nutrition without burdening the users with the manual
entry of their eating habits. We evaluated the system in a 4 week field study
in 8 households with 21 users. The results indicate that contextually situated
displays, showing shopping patterns against personal nutrition goals, can
foster a reflective and respectful approach towards better shopping and
nutrition.

%X Mobile instant messaging (e.g., via SMS or WhatsApp) often goes along with
an expectation of high attentiveness, i.e., that the receiver will notice and
read the message within a few minutes. Hence, existing instant messaging
services for mobile phones share indicators of availability, such as the last
time the user has been online. However, in this paper we not only provide
evidence that these cues create social pressure, but that they are also weak
predictors of attentiveness. As remedy, we propose to share a machine-computed
prediction of whether the user will view a message within the next few minutes
or not. For two weeks, we collected behavioral data from 24 users of mobile
instant messaging services. By the means of machine-learning techniques, we
identified that simple features extracted from the phone, such as the user's
interaction with the notification center, the screen activity, the proximity
sensor, and the ringer mode, are strong predictors of how quickly the user will
attend to the messages. With seven automatically selected features our model
predicts whether a phone user will view a message within a few minutes with
70.6% accuracy and a precision for fast attendance of 81.2%.

%X As educational games have become a larger field of study, there has been a
growing need for analytic methods that can be used to assess game design and
inform iteration. While much previous work has focused on the measurement of
student engagement or learning at a gross level, we argue that new methods are
necessary for measuring the alignment of a game to its target learning goals at
an appropriate level of detail to inform design decisions. We present a novel
technique that we have employed to examine alignment in an open-ended
educational game. The approach is based on examining how the game reacts to
representative student solutions that do and do not obey target principles. We
demonstrate this method using real student data and discuss how redesign might
be informed by these techniques.

%X There is great interest in leveraging video games to improve student
engagement and motivation. However, educational games are not uniformly
effective, and little is known about how in-game rewards affect children's
learning-related behavior. In this work, we argue that educational games can be
improved by fundamentally changing their incentive structures to promote the
growth mindset, or the belief that intelligence is malleable. We present "brain
points," a system that encourages the development of growth mindset behaviors
by directly incentivizing effort, use of strategy, and incremental progress.
Through a study of 15,000 children, we show that the "brain points" system
encourages more low-performing students to persist in the educational game
Refraction when compared to a control, and increases overall time played,
strategy use, and perseverance after challenge. We believe that this growth
mindset incentive structure has great potential in many educational
environments.

framework that utilizes a large set of users to explore the effects of
different parts of an intervention parameter space on any objective function.
We also incorporate importance sampling, allowing us to run these automatic
experiments even if we cannot give out the exact intervention distributions
that we want. To show the utility of this framework, we present an
implementation in the domain of fractions and numberlines, using an online
educational game as the source of players. Our system is able to automatically
explore the parameter space and generate hypotheses about what types of
numberlines lead to maximal short-term transfer; testing on a separate dataset
shows the most promising hypotheses are valid. We briefly discuss our results
in the context of the wider educational literature, showing that one of our
results is not explained by current research on multiple fraction
representations, thus proving our ability to generate potentially interesting
hypotheses to test.

was the strongest factor associated with the amount of spending. Study 2
examined purchasing patterns of players who spent real money: high real-money

%X Crowdsourcing complex creative tasks remains difficult, in part because
these tasks require skilled workers. Most crowdsourcing platforms do not help
workers acquire the skills necessary to accomplish complex creative tasks. In
this paper, we describe a platform that combines learning and crowdsourcing to
benefit both the workers and the requesters. Workers gain new skills through
interactive step-by-step tutorials and test their knowledge by improving
real-world images submitted by requesters. In a series of three deployments
spanning two years, we varied the design of our platform to enhance the
learning experience and improve the quality of the crowd work. We tested our
approach in the context of LevelUp for Photoshop, which teaches people how to
do basic photograph improvement tasks using Adobe Photoshop. We found that by
using our system workers gained new skills and produced high-quality edits for
requested images, even if they had little prior experience editing images.

%X Game and gamification elements are increasingly seeing use as part of
interface designs for applications seeking to engage and retain users whilst
transferring information. This paper presents an evaluation of a game-based
approach seeking to improve the road safety behaviour amongst children aged
9-15 within the UK, made available outside of a classroom context as an online,
browser-based, free-to-play game. The paper reports on data for 99,683 players
over 315,882 discrete logins, supplemented by results from a
nationally-representative survey of children at UK schools (n=1,108), an
incentivized survey of the player-base (n=1,028), and qualitative data obtained
through a series of one-to-one interviews aged 9-14 (n=28). Analysis
demonstrates the reach of the game to its target demographic, with 88.13% of
players within the UK. A 3.94 male/female ratio was observed amongst players
surveyed, with an age distribution across the target range of 9-15. Noting mean
and median playtimes of 93 and 31 minutes (n=99,683), it is suggested such an
approach to user engagement and retention can surpass typical contact times
obtained through other forms of web-based content. The size of the player-base
attracted to the game and players' qualitative feedback demonstrates the
potential for serious games deployed on a national scale.

are able to resist their desires for unhealthy choices, they experience pride
and satisfaction. In order to alleviate the former and support the latter, we
designed, implemented and tested a mobile application for improving snacking
behavior. Our application delivers a food craving reduction intervention at the
moment of need and allows users to track how often they successfully resisted
cravings. Our craving reduction intervention is based on recent research that
shows that food cravings can be reduced through imagery techniques. We
conducted a week-long evaluation of our application, comparing the
effectiveness of our application to a basic tracking application. We found that
our imagery application significantly reduced both overall snacking and
unhealthy snacking compared to a simple snack-tracking application.

are created by people who surround them. Promoting positive attitudes towards
persons with disabilities is an integral step in removing these barriers and
improving their quality of life. In this context, persuasive games offer an
opportunity of encouraging attitude change. We created a wheelchair-controlled
persuasive game to study how embodied interaction can be applied to influence
player attitudes over time. Our results show that the game intervention
successfully raised awareness for challenges that people using wheelchairs
face, and that embodied interaction is a more effective approach than
traditional input in terms of retaining attitude change over time. Based on
these findings, we provide design strategies for embodied interaction in
persuasive games, and outline how our findings can be leveraged to help
designers create effective persuasive experiences beyond games.

%X The recruitment of participants for online survey research presents many
challenges. In this work, we present four experiments examining how two
different kinds of "surprise" financial incentives affect the rate of
participation in a longitudinal study when participants are initially solicited
with either an appeal to intrinsic motivation to participate in research or one
that also offers extrinsic financial incentives. We find that unexpected
financial incentives ("existence surprises") presented to people who click a
recruitment advertisement focused on intrinsic incentives lead to a lower
recruitment rate than do the same incentives offered to those who clicked an
advertisement that led them to expect it. However, when potential participants
expect a financial incentive, surprising them with a higher amount ("amount
surprises") yields a higher recruitment rate. We interpret these results in the
context of crowding theory. Neither type of surprise affected ongoing
participation, measured as the number of questions and questionnaires completed
over the course of the study.

suffer from the Midas Touch problem: every user motion can be interpreted as an
interaction. In response, we developed an algorithm that combines facial
features, body pose and motion to approximate a user's intention to interact
with the system. We show how this can be used to determine when to pay
attention to a user's actions and when to ignore them. To demonstrate the value
of our approach, we present results from a 30-person lab study conducted to
compare four engagement algorithms in single and multi-user scenarios. We found
that combining intention to interact with a 'raise an open hand in front of
you' gesture yielded the best results. The latter approach offers a 12%
improvement in accuracy and a 20% reduction in time to engage over a baseline
'wave to engage' gesture currently used on the Xbox 360.

measurements from 75 participants through two lab studies and a field study. In
the first lab study, we evaluated the feasibility of our concept and basic
properties of features to narrow down the design space. In the second lab
study, our system achieved a 1% equal error rate in user identification among
seven registered users after two weeks following initial registration. We also
found that our system was robust even when lower body segments could not be
measured because of occlusions. In the field study, our system achieved 0.5 to
1.6% equal error rates, demonstrating that the system also works well in
ecologically valid situations. Lastly, throughout the studies, our participants
were positive about the system.

%X Motion platforms are used to increase the realism of virtual interaction.
Unfortunately, their size and weight is proportional to the size of what they
actuate. We present haptic turk, a different approach to motion platforms that
is light and mobile. The key idea is to replace motors and mechanical
components with humans. All haptic turk setups consist of a player who is
supported by one or more turkers. The player enjoys an interactive experience,
such as a flight simulation. The motion in the player's experience is generated
by the turkers who manually lift, tilt, and push the player's limbs or torso.
To get the timing and force right, timed motion instructions in a format
familiar from rhythm games are displayed on turkers' mobile devices, which they
attach to the player's body. We demonstrate a range of installations based on
mobile phones, projectors, and head-mounted displays. In our user study,
participants rated not only the experience as player as enjoyable (6.1/7), but
also the experience as a turker (4.4/7). The approach of leveraging humans
allows us to deploy our approach anytime anywhere, as we demonstrate by
experimentally deploying at an art festival in the Nevada desert.

Audience members' experiences are not well understood, nor are the factors of
videogaming sessions that influence their experience. We conducted a study to
examine the effects of game physicality and turn anticipation on audience
members' experiences in social videogaming sessions. Pairs of participants
played games under three conditions of physicality (controller-based, Wii, and
Kinect) and their expectation of turn-taking was manipulated. Their enjoyment,
game engagement, social engagement and sense of participation were measured. We
found that the introduction of turn-taking into the session had positive
effects for audience members -- both anticipated and residual play effects --
and that Kinect gameplay resulted in a more enjoyable experience for audience
members. We argue that audience members' experience changes as they become more
active within a session, and suggest there are design opportunities between
purely active 'players' and passive 'audience members'.

%X Thermal cameras have recently drawn the attention of HCI researchers as a
new sensory system enabling novel interactive systems. They are robust to
illumination changes and make it easy to separate human bodies from the image
background. Far-infrared radiation, however, has another characteristic that
distinguishes thermal cameras from their RGB or depth counterparts, namely
thermal reflection. Common surfaces reflect thermal radiation differently than
visual light and can be perfect thermal mirrors. In this paper, we show that
through thermal reflection, thermal cameras can sense the space beyond their
direct field-of-view. A thermal camera can sense areas besides and even behind
its field-of-view through thermal reflection. We investigate how thermal
reflection can increase the interaction space of projected surfaces using
camera-projection systems. We moreover discuss the reflection characteristics
of common surfaces in our vicinity in both the visual and thermal radiation
bands. Using a proof-of-concept prototype, we demonstrate the increased
interaction space for hand-held camera-projection system. Furthermore, we
depict a number of promising application examples that can benefit from the
thermal reflection characteristics of surfaces.

%X We present MisTable, a tabletop system that combines a conventional
horizontal interactive surface with personal screens between the user and the
tabletop surface. These personal screens, built using fog, are both see-through
and reach-through. Being see-through provides direct line of sight of the
personal screen and the elements behind it on the tabletop. Being reach-through
allows the user to switch from interacting with the personal screen to reaching
through it to interact with the tabletop or the space above it. The personal
screen allows a range of customisations and novel interactions such as
presenting 2D personal contents on the screen, 3D contents above the tabletop
or augmenting and relighting tangible objects differently for each user.
Besides, having a personal screen for each user allows us to customize the view
of each of them according to their identity or preferences. Finally, the
personal screens preserve all well-established tabletop interaction techniques
like touch and tangible interactions. We explore the challenges in building
such a reach-through system through a proof-of-concept implementation and
discuss the possibilities afforded by the system.

%X Device deformation allows new types of gestures to be used in interaction.
We identify that the gesture/use-case pairings proposed by interaction
designers are often driven by factors relating improved tangibility, spatial
directionality and strong metaphorical bonds. With this starting point, we
argue that some of the designs may not make use of the full potential of
deformation gestures as continuous, bipolar input techniques. In two user
studies, we revisited the basics of deformation input by taking a new
systematic look at the question of matching gestures with use cases. We
observed comparable levels of UX when using bend input in different continuous
bipolar interactions, irrespective of the choice of tangibility, directionality
and metaphor. We concluded that device bend gestures use their full potential
when used to control continuous bipolar parameters, and when quick reactions
are needed. From our studies, we also identify relative strengths of absolute
and relative mappings, and report a Fitts' law study for device bending input.

phone which aligns the projector to project onto a physical surface to allow
tabletop-like interaction in a mobile setup. The projection is created behind
the upright standing phone and is touch and gesture-enabled. Multiple
projections can be merged to create shared spaces for multi-user collaboration.
We investigate this new setup, starting with the concept that we evaluated with
a concept prototype. Furthermore we present our technical prototype, a mobile
phone case with integrated projector that allows for the aforementioned
interaction. We discuss its technical requirements and evaluate the accuracy of
interaction in a second user study. We conclude with lessons learned and design
guidelines.

%X A replication is an attempt to confirm an earlier study's findings. It is
often claimed that research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) contains too
few replications. To investigate this claim we examined four publication
outlets (891 papers) and found 3% attempting replication of an earlier result.
The replications typically confirmed earlier findings, but treated replication
as a confirm/not-confirm decision, rarely analyzing effect sizes or comparing
in depth to the replicated paper. When asked, most authors agreed that their
studies were replications, but rarely planned them as such. Many
non-replication studies could have corroborated earlier work if they had
analyzed data differently or used minimal effort to collect extra data. We
discuss what these results mean to HCI, including how reporting of studies
could be improved and how conferences/journals may change author instructions
to get more replications.

%X As Norman's vision of affordances developed twenty-six years ago is unable
to address complex challenges faced by today's designers, we outline a view of
affordances as discursive relations in HCI design. This argument is framed in
the discussion of a larger trend of work beyond the HCI field, the scholarship
on relational affordances from the fields of communication and organization
studies. Through comparison and interrogation, we maintain a relational
approach of affordances that bind the material and the discursive will help us
to address design issues such as discursive power, cultural values, performed
identities, mediated agency, and articulated voices in this increasingly
globalized world and design culturally sensitive technology for transformation
and emancipation. With a few cases, this paper deciphers the hidden power
relationship of interaction design and suggests ways of we should design for
social affordances.

%X This paper argues that a new paradigm for HCI research, which we label the
'practice' perspective, has been emerging in recent years. This stands in
contrast to the prevailing mainstream HCI paradigm, which we term the
'interaction' perspective. The 'practice turn', as it has been dubbed in the
social sciences, provides a conceptual frame to organize a variety of issues
emerging in more recent HCI research. While this approach has been present in
certain strands of HCI research for some time, it has not been articulated
fully to date. In this paper, we provide a short account of the main tenets of
this perspective, and then show how it can illuminate some of the recent
debates within HCI. Our argument is one which does not seek to replace extant
HCI theories, but rather to provide an alternative, complementary theoretical
lens which may illuminate the present confusion among both researchers and
practitioners as to the direction of HCI. The paper articulates a set of issues
which can help direct HCI research programs, as well as highlighting the
potential contribution of the HCI field to this practice approach itself, in
terms of a more nuanced understanding of emerging practices.

%X Social media platforms have emerged as prominent information sharing
ecosystems in the context of a variety of recent crises, ranging from mass
emergencies, to wars and political conflicts. We study affective responses in
social media and how they might indicate desensitization to violence
experienced in communities embroiled in an armed conflict. Specifically, we
examine three established affect measures: negative affect, activation, and
dominance as observed on Twitter in relation to a number of statistics on
protracted violence in four major cities afflicted by the Mexican Drug War.
During a two year period (Aug 2010 -- Dec 2012), while violence was on the rise
in these regions, our findings show a decline in negative emotional expression
as well as a rise in emotional arousal and dominance in Twitter posts: aspects
known to be psychological markers of desensitization. We discuss the
implications of our work for behavioral health, facilitating rehabilitation
efforts in communities enmeshed in an acute and persistent urban warfare, and
the impact on civic engagement.

emergent social movement primarily located on a Facebook page to contribute
understanding of the conduct of everyday politics in social media and through
this open up research agendas for HCI. The analysis focuses on how interactions
and contributions facilitated the emergence of a collective with political
will. We lay out an exploration of the intrinsic relationship between cultural
memories, cultural expression and everyday politics and show how diverging
voices co-constructed dynamic collectives capable of political action. We look
at how interactions through the Facebook page challenge traditional ways for
conceiving politics and the political. We outline possible research agendas in
the field of everyday politics, which are sensitive to the everyday acts of
resistance enclosed in the ordinary.

%X In this paper, we describe results from fieldwork conducted at a social
services site where the workers evaluate citizens' applications for food and
medical assistance submitted via an e-government system. These results suggest
value tensions that result -- not from different stakeholders with different
values -- but from differences among how stakeholders enact the same shared
value in practice. In the remainder of this paper, we unpack the distinct and
conflicting interpretations or logics of three shared values -- efficiency,
access, and education. In particular, we analyze what happens when social
services workers have ideas about what it means to expand access, increase
efficiency, and educate the public that conflict with the logics embedded in
the e-government system. By distinguishing between overarching values and
specific logics, we provide an analytic framework for exploring value tensions
as values are enacted in practice.

%X A national study by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau revealed that
motorcyclist deaths were nearly thirty times more prevalent than that of
drivers of other vehicles. These fatalities represent approximately 5% of all
highway deaths each year, yet motorcycles account for only 2% of all registered
vehicles in the USA. Motorcyclists are highly exposed on the road, so
maintaining situational awareness at all times is crucial. Route guidance
systems enable users to efficiently navigate between locations using dynamic
visual maps and audio directions, and have been well tested with motorists, but
remain unsafe for use by motorcyclists. Audio/visual routing systems decrease
motorcyclists' situational awareness and vehicle control, and thus elevate
chances of an accident. To enable motorcyclists to take advantage of route
guidance while maintaining situational awareness, we created HaptiMoto, a
wearable haptic route guidance system. HaptiMoto uses tactile signals to encode
the distance and direction of approaching turns, thus avoiding interference
with audio/visual awareness. Our evaluations demonstrate that HaptiMoto is both
intuitive and a safer alternative for motorcyclists compared to existing
solutions.

%X Mobile location recognition by capturing images of the environment (visual
localization) is a promising technique for indoor navigation in arbitrary
surroundings. However, it has barely been investigated so far how the user
interface (UI) can cope with the challenges of the vision-based localization
technique, such as varying quality of the query images. We implemented a novel
UI for visual localization, consisting of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented
Reality (AR) views that actively communicate and ensure localization accuracy.
If necessary, the system encourages the user to point the smartphone at
distinctive regions to improve localization quality. We evaluated the UI in a
experimental navigation task with a prototype, informed by initial evaluation
results using design mockups. We found that VR can contribute to efficient and
effective indoor navigation even at unreliable location and orientation
accuracy. We discuss identified challenges and share lessons learned as
recommendations for future work.

ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth semi-structured interviews to elicit

driving and general work conditions. We explore how passengers influence the
movement of the bus and how the technology frames bus drivers' relationships to
their managers and commuters. This work contributes to our understanding of the
impact of LBS in the workplace and shows how technological imperatives can be
established that cause unanticipated consequences and gradually undermine human
relationships.

%X While mobile phones affect our behavior and tend to separate us from our
physical environment, this very environment could instead become a responsive
part of the information domain. For navigation using a map while cycling in an
urban environment, we studied two alternative solutions: smartphone display and
projection on the road. This paper firstly demonstrates by proof-of-concept a
GPS-based map navigation using a bike-mounted projector. Secondly, it
implements a prototype using both a projector and a smartphone mounted on a
bike, comparing them for use in a navigation system for nighttime cycling.
Thirdly, it examines how visuo-spatial factors influence navigation. We believe
that our findings will be useful for designing navigation systems for bikes and
even for cars, helping cyclists and drivers be more attentive to their
environment while navigating, and to provide useful information while moving.

level of automation (pedal automated, wheel automated or fully automated
driving) and the interface modality (switching automation on or off via touch
or voice control) in automated vehicles influence drivers' perceived experience
and performance. The results found that full or wheel automation in vehicles
was perceived significantly more intelligent than pedal automation.
Furthermore, drivers in the pedal automation condition reported greater
nervousness when using the touch interface than the voice interface. This
tendency was not found among drivers in the full and wheel automation
conditions. Drivers who used the voice interface to control automated driving
had fewer driving mistakes than those who operated the touch interface. Our
findings have important psychological and practical implications for designing
a user interface for automated vehicles.

takes advantage of the common habit of turning to the mobile phone in spare

%X Researchers have long known that aggregate estimations built from the
collected opinions of a large group of people often outperform the estimations
of individual experts. This phenomenon is generally described as the "Wisdom of
Crowds". This approach has shown promise with respect to the task of accurately
forecasting future events. Previous research has demonstrated the value of
utilizing meta-forecasts (forecasts about what others in the group will
predict) when aggregating group predictions. In this paper, we describe an
extension to meta-forecasting and demonstrate the value of modeling the
familiarity among a population's members (its social network) and applying this
model to forecast aggregation. A pair of studies demonstrates the value of
taking this model into account, and the described technique produces aggregate
forecasts for future events that are significantly better than the standard
Wisdom of Crowds approach as well as previous meta-forecasting techniques.

%X Recent research in human computation has focused on improving the quality of
work done by crowd workers on crowdsourcing platforms. Multiple approaches have
been adopted like filtering crowd workers through qualification tasks, and
aggregating responses from multiple crowd workers to obtain consensus. We
investigate here how improving the presentation of the task itself by using
cognitively inspired features affects the performance of crowd workers. We
illustrate this with a case-study for the task of extracting text from scanned
images. We generated six task-presentation designs by modifying two parameters
-- visual saliency of the target fields and working memory requirements -- and
conducted experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and with an eye-tracker
in the lab setting. Our results identify which task-design parameters (e.g.
highlighting target fields) result in improved performance, and which ones do
not (e.g. reducing the number of distractors). In conclusion, we claim that the
use of cognitively inspired features for task design is a powerful technique
for maximizing the performance of crowd workers.

%X We present findings from a qualitative study of self-search, also known as
ego or vanity search. In the context of a broader study about personal online
content, participants were asked to search for themselves using their own
computers and the browsers and queries they would normally adopt. Our analysis
highlights five motivations for self-search: as a form of identity management;
to discover reactions to and reuse of user-generated media; to re-find personal
content; as a form of entertainment; and to reveal lost or forgotten content.
Strategies vary according to motivation, and may differ markedly from typical
information-seeking, with users looking deep into the results and using image
search to identify content about themselves. We argue that two dimensions
underpin ways of improving self-search: controllability and expectedness, and
discuss what these dimensions imply for design.

%X Navigating to files through a hierarchy is often a slow, laborious, and
repetitive task. Recent lab studies showed that file browser interface
augmentations, such as Icon Highlights and Search Directed Navigation, have the
potential to reduce file retrieval times. However, for this potential to be
realised in actual systems, further study is necessary to address two important
issues. First, there are important design and implementation challenges in
advancing the research prototypes previously evaluated into complete
interactive systems that can be used for real work. Second, it is unknown how
real users would employ these systems while engaged in actual work; would the
potential performance improvements suggested by the earlier lab studies be
realised? We therefore describe the design, implementation, and longitudinal
field study evaluation of Finder Highlights, a file browser plugin for the OS X
'Finder' that adds support for Icon Highlights and Search Directed Navigation.
Study results confirm that the augmentations are effective in reducing
real-world file retrieval times, with retrieval times 13% faster when using
Finder Highlights compared to the standard tool (10.6 s versus 12.2 s), while
also emphasising important differences between lab and field studies. In
summary, the paper strongly suggests that large-scale deployment of interface
augmentations to file browsers, particularly Icon Highlights, will have a
marked effect in improving users' real-world file retrieval.

%X Individual differences are prevalent in personal information management
(PIM). There is large variation between individuals in how they structure and
retrieve information from personal archives. These differences make it hard to
develop general PIM tools. However we know little about the origins of these
differences. We present two studies evaluating whether differences arise from
personality traits, by exploring whether different personalities structure
personal archives differently. The first exploratory study asks participants to
identify PIM cues that signal personality traits. While the aim was to identify
cues, these cues also proved surprisingly accurate indicators of personality.
In a second study, to evaluate these cues, we directly measure relations
between structure and traits. We demonstrate that Conscientiousness predicts
file organization, particularly PC users' desktops. Neurotic people may also
keep more desktop files. One implication is that systems might be customized
for different personalities. We also advance personality theory, showing that
personal digital artifacts signal personality.

%X Content on computer screens is often inaccessible to users because it is
hidden, e.g., occluded by other windows, outside the viewport, or overlooked.
In search tasks, the efficient retrieval of sought content is important.
Current software, however, only provides limited support to visualize hidden
occurrences and rarely supports search synchronization crossing application
boundaries. To remedy this situation, we introduce two novel visualization
methods to guide users to hidden content. Our first method generates awareness
for occluded or out-of-viewport content using see-through visualization. For
content that is either outside the screen's viewport or for data sources not
opened at all, our second method shows off-screen indicators and an on-demand
smart preview. To reduce the chances of overlooking content, we use visual
links, i.e., visible edges, to connect the visible content or the visible
representations of the hidden content. We show the validity of our methods in a
user study, which demonstrates that our technique enables a faster localization
of hidden content compared to traditional search functionality and thereby
assists users in information retrieval tasks.

%X Previous studies have shown that people can effectively detect emotions in
text-only messages written in their native languages. But is this the same for
non-native speakers' In this paper, we conduct an experiment where native
English speakers (NS) and Japanese non-native English speakers (NNS) rate the
emotional valence in text-only messages written by native English-speaking
authors. They also annotate all emotional cues (words, symbols and emoticons)
that affected their rating. Accuracy of NS and NNS ratings and annotations are
calculated by comparing their average correlations with author ratings and
annotations used as a gold standard. Our results conclude that NNS are
significantly less accurate at detecting the emotional valence of messages,
especially when the messages include highly negative words. Although NNS are as
accurate as NS at detecting emotional cues, they are not able to make use of
symbols (exclamation marks) and emoticons to detect the emotional valence of
text-only messages.

word plays. We select effective keywords by considering phonetic, orthographic
and semantic word similarity, and word concept imageability. We show that
keywords provided by TransPhoner improve learner performance in an online

harder words. Participants rated TransPhoner keywords as more helpful than a
random keyword baseline, and almost as helpful as manually selected keywords.
Comments also indicated higher engagement in the learning task, and more desire
to continue learning. We demonstrate additional applications to tasks such as
pure phonetic transliteration, generation of mnemonics for complex vocabulary,
and topic-based transformation of song lyrics.

problematic in developing regions. We show the value of the technique via user

%X Translating the text in an interface is a challenging task. Besides the
jargon and technical terms, many of the strings are often very short, such as
those shown in buttons and pull-down menus. Then, as a result of the lack of
visual context in the traditional localization process, an important ambiguity
problem arises. We study three approaches to solve this problem: using plain
gettext (baseline condition), using gettext plus being able to operate the UI,
and translating the UI in-place. We found that translators are substantially
faster with plain gettext but commit a significantly higher number of errors in
comparison to the other approaches. Unexpectedly, the mixed condition was
slower and more error-prone than in-place translation. The latter was found to
be comparable to plain gettext in terms of time, although some strings passed
unnoticed as the UI was operated. Based on our results, we arrive at a set of
recommendations to augment localization tools to improve translator's
productivity.

%X We propose to improve real-time communication between people who do not
share a common language by foregrounding potential problems in machine
translation. We developed a prototype chat tool that displays two parallel
translations of each chat turn, with the thought that comparing the
translations might both highlight problems and provide resources for resolving
them. We conducted a user study to investigate how people use and like such an
interface compared to a standard one-translation interface. On balance, users
preferred two translations to one, using them to both notice differences and
infer meaning from uncertain translations, with no increase in workload. This
suggests that this interface may help improve cross-lingual communication in
practical applications and lays the groundwork for a larger design space around
systems that highlight possible errors to support communication.

%X The neurodiversity movement seeks to positively reframe certain neurological
conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and dyslexia, by
concentrating on their strengths. In recent years, neurodiverse children have
increasingly been involved in the technology design process, but the design
approaches adopted have focused mostly on overcoming difficulties of working
with these children, leaving their strengths untapped. We present a new
participatory design (PD) framework, Diversity for Design (D4D), which provides
guidance for technology designers working with neurodiverse children in
establishing PD methods that capitalize on children's strengths and also
support potential difficulties. We present two case studies of use of the D4D
framework, involving children with ASD and dyslexia, showing how it informed
the development and refinement of PD methods tailored to these populations. In
addition, we show how to apply the D4D framework to other neurodiverse
populations.

%X Many people with Diabetes live with the continuous threat of hypoglycemic
attacks and the danger of going into coma. Diabetes Alert Dogs are trained to
detect the onset of an attack before the condition of the human handler they
are paired with deteriorates, giving them time to take action. We investigated
requirements for designing an alarm system allowing dogs to remotely call for
help when their human falls unconscious before being able to react to an alert.
Through a multispecies ethnographic approach we focus on the requirements for a
physical canine user interface, involving dogs, their handlers and specialist
dog trainers in the design process. We discuss tensions between the
requirements for canine and the human users, argue the need for increased
sensitivity towards the needs of individual dogs that goes beyond breed
specific physical characteristics, and reflect on how we can move from
designing for dogs to designing with dogs.

%X The availability of health-promoting resources for young children diagnosed
with cancer who are transitioning from intensive care to everyday life is
limited. In the context of designing digital peer support services for children
who are considered vulnerable due to clinical and age-related aspects, there
are several challenges that put critical requirements on a user-centered design
process. This paper reports on a new method for co-constructing child-personas
that are tailored for developing health-promoting services where empirical data
is restricted due to practical and ethical reasons. In particular, we are
proposing to focus children design workshop sessions on salutogenesis, and
complement this with a pathogenic perspective by interviewing healthcare
professionals and parents. We also introduce the use of proxy personas, and
redemption scenarios in the form of comicboards, both collaboratively
constructed by children and designers through storytelling. By applying four
progressive steps of data collection and analysis we arrive at authentic
child-personas that can be used to design and develop health-promoting services
for children in vulnerable life stages.

evaluation, and simulated resuscitation sessions, we identified the main
information features to include on our display. Our results focus on how we
balanced the design tensions that emerged when addressing the ad hoc,
hierarchical, and multidisciplinary nature of trauma teamwork. We discuss the
implications of balancing role-based differences for each information feature,
as well as two major design tensions: process-based vs. state-based designs and
role-based vs. team-based displays.

%X Error Related Negativity is triggered when a user either makes a mistake or
the application behaves differently from their expectation. It can also appear
while observing another user making a mistake. This paper investigates ERN in
collaborative settings where observing another user (the executer) perform a
task is typical and then explores its applicability to HCI. We first show that
ERN can be detected on signals captured by commodity EEG headsets like an
Emotiv headset when observing another person perform a typical multiple-choice
reaction time task. We then investigate the anticipation effects by detecting
ERN in the time interval when an executer is reaching towards an answer. We
show that we can detect this signal with both a clinical EEG device and with an
Emotiv headset. Our results show that online single trial detection is possible
using both headsets during tasks that are typical of collaborative interactive
applications. However there is a trade-off between the detection speed and the
quality/prices of the headsets. Based on the results, we discuss and present
several HCI scenarios for use of ERN in observing tasks and collaborative
settings.

%X Dynamic difficulty adjustments can be used in human-computer systems in
order to improve user engagement and performance. In this paper, we use
functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to obtain passive brain sensing
data and detect extended periods of boredom or overload. From these
physiological signals, we can adapt a simulation in order to optimize workload
in real-time, which allows the system to better fit the task to the user from
moment to moment. To demonstrate this idea, we ran a laboratory study in which
participants performed path planning for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) in a simulation. Based on their state, we varied the difficulty of the
task by adding or removing UAVs and found that we were able to decrease error
by 35% over a baseline condition. Our results show that we can use fNIRS brain
sensing to detect task difficulty in real-time and construct an interface that
improves user performance through dynamic difficulty adjustment.

%X The Think Aloud Protocol (TAP) is a verbalisation technique widely employed
in HCI user studies to give insight into user experience, yet little work has
explored the impact that TAPs have on participants during user studies. This
paper utilises a brain sensing technique, fNIRS, to observe the effect that
TAPs have on participants. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a
brain sensing technology that offers the potential to provide continuous,
detailed insight into brain activity, enabling an objective view of cognitive
processes during complex tasks. Participants were asked to perform a
mathematical task under 4 conditions: nonsense verbalisations, passive
concurrent think aloud protocol, invasive concurrent think aloud protocol, and
a baseline of silence. Subjective ratings and performance measures were
collected during the study. Our results provide a novel view into the effect
that different forms of verbalisation have on workload during tasks. Further,
the results provide a means for estimating the effect of spoken artefacts when
measuring workload, which is another step towards our goal of proactively
involving fNIRS analysis in ecologically valid user studies.

%X Audio notifications are an important means of prompting users of electronic
products. Although useful in most environments, audio notifications are
ineffective in certain situations, especially against particular auditory
backgrounds or when the user is distracted. Several studies have used
behavioral performance to evaluate audio notifications, but these studies
failed to achieve consistent results due to factors including user subjectivity
and environmental differences; thus, a new method and more objective indicators
are necessary. In this study, we propose an approach based on
electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate audio notifications by measuring
users' auditory perceptual responses (mismatch negativity) and attention
shifting (P3a). We demonstrate our approach by applying it to the usability
testing of audio notifications in realistic scenarios, such as users performing
a major task amid ambient noises. Our results open a new perspective for
evaluating the design of the audio notifications.

%X We present a new approach to rapid prototyping of functional objects, such
as the body of a head-mounted display. The key idea is to save 3D printing time
by automatically substituting sub-volumes with standard building blocks'in our
case Lego bricks. When making the body for a head-mounted display, for example,
getting the optical path right is paramount. Users thus mark the lens mounts as
"high-resolution" to indicate that these should later be 3D printed.
faBrickator then 3D prints these parts. It also generates instructions that
show users how to create everything else from Lego bricks. If users iterate on
the design later, faBrickator offers even greater benefit as it allows
re-printing only the elements that changed. We validated our system at the
example of three 3D models of functional objects. On average, our system
fabricates objects 2.44 times faster than traditional 3D printing while
requiring only 14 minutes of manual assembly.

activity in the form of material artifacts. By designing such material
representations, we aim to understand what these artifacts might offer in terms
of reflecting upon physical activity. For example, what types of affect do
material artifacts, representing ones' physical activity create for the user'
In order to advance this understanding, we designed a system called SweatAtoms
that transforms the physical activity data based on heart rate into 3D printed
material artifacts. We conducted an 'in the wild study' by deploying our system
in six households where participants were experiencing five different material
representations of their physical activity for a period of two weeks each. We
found that the material artifacts made participants more conscious about their
involvement in physical activity and illustrated different levels of engagement
with the artifacts. Along with reporting the gained insights from the
deployments, we offer reflections on designing material representations for
physical activity. We hope that our work will inspire designers to consider new
possibilities afforded by digital fabrication to support user's experience with
physical activity by utilizing interactive technologies at our disposal.

%X This paper presents a novel mathematical model for visual search and
selection time in linear menus. Assuming two visual search strategies, serial
and directed, and a pointing sub-task, it captures the change of performance
with five factors: 1) menu length, 2) menu organization, 3) target position, 4)
absence/presence of target, and 5) practice. The novel aspect is that the model
is expressed as probability density distribution of gaze, which allows for
deriving total selection time. We present novel data that replicates and
extends the Nielsen menu selection paradigm and uses eye-tracking and mouse
tracking to confirm model predictions. The same parametrization yielded a high
fit to both menu selection time and gaze distributions. The model has the
potential to improve menu designs by helping designers identify more effective
solutions without conducting empirical studies.

%X Being able to predict the performance of interface designs using models of
human cognition and performance is a long-standing goal of HCI research. This
paper presents recent advances in cognitive modeling which permit increasingly
realistic and accurate predictions for visual human-computer interaction tasks
such as icon search by incorporating an "active vision" approach which
emphasizes eye movements to visual features based on the availability of
features in relationship to the point of gaze. A high fidelity model of a
classic visual search task demonstrates the value of incorporating visual
acuity functions into models of visual performance. The features captured by
the high-fidelity model are then used to formulate a model simple enough for
practical use, which is then implemented in an easy-to-use GLEAN modeling tool.
Easy-to-use predictive models for complex visual search are thus feasible and
should be further developed.

%X Human multitasking often involves complex task interactions and subtle
tradeoffs which might be best understood through detailed computational
cognitive modeling, yet traditional cognitive modeling approaches may not
explore a sufficient range of task strategies to reveal the true complexity of
multitasking behavior. This study proposes a systematic approach for exploring
a large number of strategies using a computer-cluster-based parallelized
modeling system. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the approach for
investigating and revealing the effects of different microstrategies on human
performance, both within and across individuals, for a time-pressured
multimodal dual task. The modeling results suggest that multitasking
performance is not simply a matter of interleaving cognitive and sensorimotor
processing but is instead heavily influenced by the selection of subtask
microstrategies.

%X When searching a display, users sometimes know what the target is but
sometimes do not. It has generally been assumed that for this latter case
people must engage in a deeper semantic evaluation of items during the search
process. This idea is central to Information Foraging theory. But do people
actually spend longer assessing items when engaged in a semantically demanding
search task' We investigate this by having participants locate target items in
16-item menus. Participants were either told exactly what to look for
(known-item search) or they were told the category that the target belonged to
(semantic search). Participants were faster and more accurate at known-item
searches. Eye-movement data show that this was because participants were more
likely to skip over items when performing known-item searches. Contrary to
expectation, we found limited empirical evidence to support the idea that
deeper semantic evaluations of items lead to longer gaze durations (this
occurred only when items were arranged very close together). This finding is
important because it reveals how people adopt different eye gaze strategies
depending on the kind of search activity they are engaged in.

%X Predictive models in HCI, such as models of user performance, are often
expressed as multivariate nonlinear regressions. This approach has been
preferred, because it is compact and allows scrutiny. However, existing
modeling tools in HCI, along with the common statistical packages, are limited
to predefined nonlinear models or support linear models only. To assist
researchers in the task of identifying novel nonlinear models, we propose a
stochastic local search method that constructs equations iteratively. Instead
of predefining a model equation, the researcher defines constraints that guide
the search process. Comparison of outputs to published baselines in HCI shows
improvements in model fit in seven out of 11 cases. We present a few ways in
which the method can help HCI researchers explore modeling problems. We
conclude that the approach is particularly suitable for complex datasets that
have many predictor variables.

%X Online technologies are promising for helping older adults maintain social
connectedness, particularly with younger people, yet many older adults resist
or participate minimally in the mainstream technologies used by younger members
of their social network. We present results from an interview study involving
22 older adults (age 71-92) to understand communication preferences and values
related to social media. Seniors articulate many concerns with online social
media, including the time required for legitimate participation, the loss of
deeper communication, content irrelevance, and privacy. Additionally, older
adults engage in social practices that could be supported by online social
technologies, but they rarely use such tools. The theme of material social
communications emerges from our data, and we examine this in context of online
social media. We conclude with design considerations for the development of
social media for older adults, and as part of this we describe the notion of
bridging technologies as a framework for intergenerational communication
design.

technologies to improve the lives of older people, such as those who are
suffering from frailty or memory loss. Our research adopts a very different
approach, reframing the relationship in terms of wisdom, creativity and
invention. We ran a series of workshops where groups of retirees, aged between
early 60s and late 80s, used the MaKey MaKey inventor's toolkit. We asked them
to think about inventing the future and suggest ideas for new technologies. Our
findings showed that they not only rose to the challenge but also mastered the
technology, collaborated intensely together while using it and freely and at
length discussed their own, their family's and others' relationship with
technology. We discuss the value of empowering people in this way and consider
what else could be invented to enable more people to be involved in the design
and use of creative technologies.

%X Social networking sites (SNSs) are becoming increasingly popular as a method
for social interaction. While research has reported benefits associated with
components of SNS usage, a digital divide has emerged between younger and older
users. SNSs can be useful for communicating with family members and helping one
feel digitally included; however, there are a wide range of reasons why many
older adults choose not to use this kind of technology. We present a series of
user studies investigating the barriers and challenges that SNSs can present to
older users. These user studies led to the derivation of user recommendations
to mitigate these barriers. The recommendations were then evaluated within a
comparative evaluation which involved 25 older adults completing tasks on two
interface versions of a simulation SNS. We present the recommendations and the
methods of their creation and evaluation. Implications for developers of SNSs
are discussed.

%X System design for seniors often focuses on the decline of their biological
capabilities and social connectedness. This approach has been challenged as too
simplistic to capture what it really means to be senior. This paper presents a
qualitative study of 17 seniors in urban China (age ranging from 50s to 70s),
who have adopted and incorporated ICT into their daily lives. Findings from
this study show that the ways in which seniors attend to ICT are not simply
shaped by changes in health or other wellbeing, but also by their life
attitudes, value systems, relationships to younger generations as well as
historical specifics during their coming of age. This paper contributes by
showing that 1) what it means to be senior is shaped from within a whole social
ecology of past and current experiences, values and interactions; 2) senior
identities are not fixed, but continuously negotiated, articulated and enacted
through ICT; 3) social interaction and access of technologies are highly
intertwined.

%X Designing for sociable systems requires, among other abilities, a
sensitivity to the meanings, structures, and nuances of technology-mediated
experiences that are simultaneously felt by users to be intimate and also
social. Such a sensitivity is not easily acquired, and design researchers have
recommended the use of social theories to guide designers' readings of
technology-mediated social experiences. We use philosopher Michel Foucault's
theory of identity (and social power, discourse, sexuality, creativity, and
style) known as "the care of the self," as a scaffold with which to produce a
sensitive interpretation of the intimacy (and expert social creative) practices
of adult users of the virtual world Second Life (SL). This reading sheds light
on several skilled and creative intimacy practices in SL. It also offers a
philosophically grounded hermeneutic strategy for designers interested in
analyzing intimate experiences.

%X This work explores the role of communication technologies during romantic
couple conflict, and the impact that self-esteem has on behavior, preferences
for communication channels, and attitudes about mediated communication during
conflict. Results revealed that lower levels of self-esteem and communicating
via text messaging (vs. face-to-face) were associated with increased distancing
and perceived partner distancing behaviors. Lower levels of self-esteem and
using mediated communication were also associated with a greater likelihood of
thinking that a conflict had a negative impact on the relationship. Yet, there
was no evidence to suggest that individuals with lower levels of self-esteem
exhibited more negative behaviors and perceptions in text-based communication
than in FtF communication. In addition, lower levels of self-esteem were
associated with increased use of and preferences for text-based mediated
communication over FtF communication during conflict. Overall, this study
suggests that both self-esteem and communication channel impact the nature of
romantic couple conflict.

the TPad Tablet to support affective communication between pairs of users. We
introduce three haptic applications for the TPad Tablet (text messaging, image
sharing, and virtual touch) and evaluate the applications with 24 users,
including intimate couples and strangers. Participants used haptics to
communicate literal texture, denote action within a scene, convey emotional
information, highlight content, express and engage in physical playfulness, and
to provide one's partner with an experience or sensation. We conclude that
users readily associate haptics with emotional expression and that the intimacy
of touch in the contexts we study is best suited for communications with close
social partners.

pairs of users to share wriggling movements with one another. Attached to a
smart phone, Wrigglo captures the sender's motions and activates the receiver's
Wrigglo which repeats the motion simultaneously. The result of our in-lab use
observation with twelve couples showed that Wrigglo supported emotional and
functional roles of body gestures and postures, creating vocabularies related
to the motion of specific body parts and, to some extent, reflected the
connected user's presence through the device's movement. Through its peripheral
anthropomorphization, Wrigglo can deliver new forms of telepresence by embodied
posturing and gesturing in mobile communication.

%X In this work we present a user-centered development process for a GPS-based
monitoring system to be used in dementia care. Our research covers a full
design process including a qualitative-empirical pre-study, the prototyping
process and the investigation of long-term appropriation processes of the
stable prototypes in three different practice environments. Specifically, we
deal with the problem of 'wandering' by persons suffering from late-phase
dementia. Although GPS tracking is not a novel technological objective, the
usage of those systems in dementia care remains very low. The paper therefore
takes a socio-technical stance on development and appropriation of GPS
technology in dementia care and assesses the practical and ideological issues
surrounding care to understand why. We additionally provide design research in
two different settings, familial and institutional care, and report on the
design of a GPS-based tracking system reflecting these considerations. What
comes to the fore is the need for ICT to reflect complex organizational,
ideological and practical issues that form part of a moral universe where
sensitivity is crucial.

%X China has overtaken India and the U.S. as host to the largest diabetic
population in the world. Many problems exist in the Chinese healthcare system
and very small number of diabetes patients receives treatment. Our paper
reports on a case study through the lens of an online diabetes patient
community, Sweet Home. We conducted participant observations, text analysis,
and interviews, to understand the health management of patients at Sweet Home.
Our findings reveal that patients' understanding of diabetes, their choice of
treatments, their routine management, and their interactions with others (in
the physical world) and among themselves (in the online world) are influenced
by many factors: belief in traditional Chinese versus western medicine,
cultural and social norms regarding social eating and drinking, conflicts over
self-images, and responses to comments and pressures of coworkers. That is,
social context may significantly affect patients' behaviors and each individual
patient's actions may also help reshape the social context. We draw out
implications for how our society as a whole may respond to these issues, from
the perspective of public health, education, and information technology design.

workflow video content and log data from actual end users. We then developed a
heuristic for identifying demonstration clips, and had the quality of a sample
set of clips evaluated by both domain experts and end users. This multi-step
approach allowed us to characterize the quality of 'naturally occurring' tool
demonstrations, and to derive a list of good and bad features of these videos.
Finally, we conducted an initial investigation into using machine learning
techniques to distinguish between good and bad demonstrations.

%X Millions of learners today use how-to videos to master new skills in a
variety of domains. But browsing such videos is often tedious and inefficient
because video player interfaces are not optimized for the unique step-by-step
structure of such videos. This research aims to improve the learning experience
of existing how-to videos with step-by-step annotations.
   We first performed a formative study to verify that annotations are actually
useful to learners. We created ToolScape, an interactive video player that
displays step descriptions and intermediate result thumbnails in the video
timeline. Learners in our study performed better and gained more self-efficacy
using ToolScape versus a traditional video player.
   To add the needed step annotations to existing how-to videos at scale, we
introduce a novel crowdsourcing workflow. It extracts step-by-step structure
from an existing video, including step times, descriptions, and before and
after images. We introduce the Find-Verify-Expand design pattern for temporal
and visual annotation, which applies clustering, text processing, and visual
analysis algorithms to merge crowd output. The workflow does not rely on
domain-specific customization, works on top of existing videos, and recruits
untrained crowd workers. We evaluated the workflow with Mechanical Turk, using
75 cooking, makeup, and Photoshop videos on YouTube. Results show that our
workflow can extract steps with a quality comparable to that of trained
annotators across all three domains with 77% precision and 81% recall.

tutorials on smartphone from user demonstration. For tutorial authors, it
simplifies the tutorial creation. For tutorial users, it provides contextual
step-by-step guidance and avoids the frequent context switching between
tutorials and users' primary tasks. In order to generate the tutorials
automatically, EverTutor records low-level touch events to detect gestures and
identify on-screen targets. When a tutorial is browsed, the system uses
vision-based techniques to locate the target regions and overlays the
corresponding input prompt contextually. It also identifies the correctness of
users' interaction to guide the users step by step. We conducted a 6-person
user study for creating tutorials and a 12-person user study for browsing
tutorials, and we compared EverTutor's interactive tutorials to static and
video ones. Study results show that creating tutorials by EverTutor is simpler
and faster than producing static and video tutorials. Also, when using the
tutorials, the task completion time for interactive tutorials were 3-6 times
faster than static and video tutorials regardless of age group. In terms of
user preference, 83% of the users chose interactive type as the preferred
tutorial type and rated it easiest to follow and easiest to understand.

additional source of information for readers, yet current designs for
displaying user comments on tutorial webpages do little to support their use.
Instead, comments are separated from the tutorial content they reference and
tend to be ordered according to post date. We propose and evaluate the
TaggedComments system, a new approach to displaying comments that users post to
online tutorials. Using tags supplied by commenters, TaggedComments seeks to
enhance the role of user comments by 1) improving their visibility, 2) allowing
users to personalize their use of the comments according to their particular
information needs, and 3) providing direct access to potentially helpful
comments from the tutorial content. A laboratory evaluation with 16
participants shows that, in comparison to the standard comment layout,
TaggedComments significantly improves users' subjective impressions of comment
utility when interacting with Photoshop tutorials.

%X Driving aggressively increases the risk of accidents. Assessing a person's
driving style is a useful way to guide aggressive drivers toward having safer
driving behaviors. A number of studies have investigated driving style, but
they often rely on the use of self-reports or simulators, which are not
suitable for the real-time, continuous, automated assessment and feedback on
the road. In order to understand and model aggressive driving style, we
construct an in-vehicle sensing platform that uses a smartphone instead of
using heavyweight, expensive systems. Utilizing additional cheap sensors, our
sensing platform can collect useful information about vehicle movement,
maneuvering and steering wheel movement. We use this data and apply machine
learning to build a driver model that evaluates drivers' driving styles based
on a number of driving-related features. From a naturalistic data collection
from 22 drivers for 3 weeks, we analyzed the characteristics of drivers who
have an aggressive driving style. Our model classified those drivers with an
accuracy of 90.5% (violation-class) and 81% (questionnaire-class). We describe
how, in future work, our model can be used to provide real-time feedback to
drivers using only their current smartphone.

%X Understanding the driver's cognitive load is important for evaluating
in-vehicle user interfaces. This paper describes experiments to assess machine
learning classification algorithms on their ability to automatically identify
elevated cognitive workload levels in drivers, leading towards the development
of robust tools for automobile user interface evaluation. We look at using both
driver performance as well as physiological data. These measures can be
collected in real-time and do not interfere with the primary task of driving
the vehicle. We report classification accuracies of up to 90% for detecting
elevated levels of cognitive load, and show that the inclusion of physiological
data leads to higher classification accuracy than vehicle sensor data evaluated
alone. Finally, we show results suggesting that models can be built to classify
cognitive load across individuals, instead of building individual models for
each per-son. By collecting data from drivers in two large field studies on the
highway (20 drivers and 99 drivers), this work extends prior work and
demonstrates feasibility and potential of such measures for HCI research in
vehicles.

%X Previous studies have investigated audio, visual and tactile driver
warnings, indicating the importance of communicating the appropriate level of
urgency to the drivers. However, these modalities have never been combined
exhaustively and tested under conditions of varying situational urgency to
assess their effectiveness both in the presence and absence of critical driving
events. This paper describes an experiment evaluating all multimodal
combinations of such warnings under two contexts of situational urgency: a lead
car braking and not braking. The results showed that participants responded
quicker to more urgent warnings, especially in the presence of a car braking.
They also responded faster to the multimodal as opposed to unimodal signals.
Driving behaviour improved in the presence of the warnings and the absence of a
car braking. These results highlight the influence of urgency and number of
modalities in warning design and indicate the utility of non-visual warnings in
driving.

%X Omni-directional video (ODV) is a novel medium that offers viewers a
360&deg; panoramic recording. This type of content will become more common
within our living rooms in the near future, seeing that immersive displaying
technologies such as 3D television are on the rise. However, little attention
has been given to how to interact with ODV content. We present a gesture
elicitation study in which we asked users to perform mid-air gestures that they
consider to be appropriate for ODV interaction, both for individual as well as
collocated settings. We are interested in the gesture variations and
adaptations that come forth from individual and collocated usage. To this end,
we gathered quantitative and qualitative data by means of observations, motion
capture, questionnaires and interviews. This data resulted in a user-defined
gesture set for ODV, alongside an in-depth analysis of the variation in
gestures we observed during the study.

%X Co-located work environments allow people to maintain awareness by observing
others' actions (called consequential communication), but the computerization
of many tasks has dramatically reduced the observability of work actions. The
recent interest in gestural interaction techniques offers the possibility of
recreating some of the noticeability of previous work actions, but little is
known about the observability and identifiability of command gestures. To
investigate these basic issues, we carried out a study that asked people to
observe and identify different sizes and morphologies of gestures from
different locations, while carrying out an attention-demanding primary task. We
studied small (tablet sized), medium (monitor-sized), and large (full-arm)
gestures. Our study showed that although size did have significant effects, as
expected, even small gestures were highly noticeable (rates above 75%) and
identifiable (rates above 69%). Our results provide empirical guidance about
the ways that gesture size, morphology, and location affect observation, and
show that gestural interaction has potential for improving group awareness in
co-located environments.

keyboard and mouse, while the majority of our body remains unchallenged and the
physical workspace around us stays largely unattended. Addressing this untapped
potential, we explore the concept of turning a flexible office chair into a
ubiquitous input device. To facilitate daily desktop work, we propose the
utilization of semaphoric chair gestures that can be assigned to specific
application functionalities. The exploration of two usage scenarios in the
context of focused and peripheral interaction demonstrates high potential of
chair gestures as additional input modality for opportunistic, hands-free
interaction.

%X Multi-touch and tangible interfaces provide unique opportunities for
enhancing learning and discovery with big data. However, existing interaction
techniques have limitations when manipulating large data sets. Our goal is to
define novel interaction techniques for multi-touch and tangible interfaces,
which support the construction of complex queries for big data. In this paper,
we present results from a study which investigates the use of gestural
interaction with active tokens for manipulating large data sets. In particular,
we studied user expectations of a hybrid tangible and gestural language
engaging this space. Our main results include a vocabulary of user-defined
gestures for interaction with active tokens, which extends beyond familiar
multi-touch gestures; characterization of the design space of gestural
interaction with active tokens; and insight into participants' mental models,
including common metaphors. We also present implications for the design of
multi-touch and tangible interfaces with active tokens.

%X The vision of pervasive ambient information displays which show relevant
information has not yet come true. One of the main reasons is the limited
number of available displays in the environment which is a fundamental
requirement of the original vision. We introduce the concept of an Ambient
Mobile Pervasive Display AMP-D which is a wearable projector system that
constantly projects an ambient information display in front of the user. The
floor display provides serendipitous access to public and personal information.
The display is combined with a projected display on the user's hand, forming a
continuous interaction space that is controlled by hand gestures. The paper
introduces this novel device concept, discusses its interaction design, and
explores its advantages through various implemented application examples.
Furthermore, we present the AMP-D prototype which illustrates the involved
challenges concerning hardware, sensing, and visualization.

%X Dynamic peephole navigation is an increasingly popular technique for
navigating large information spaces such as maps. Users can view the map
through handheld, spatially aware displays that serve as peepholes and navigate
the map by moving these displays in physical space. We conducted a controlled
experiment of peephole map navigation with 16 participants to better understand
the effect of a peephole's size on users' map navigation behavior, navigation
performance, and task load. Simulating different peephole sizes from 4'
(smartphone) up to 120' (control condition), we confirmed that larger peepholes
significantly improve learning speed, navigation speed, and reduce task load;
however, this added benefit diminishes with growing sizes. Our data shows that
a relatively small, tablet-sized peephole can serve as a 'sweet spot' between
peephole size and both user navigation performance and user task load.

%X We present Mechanical Force Redistribution (MFR): a method of sensing which
creates an anti-aliased image of forces applied to a surface. This technique
mechanically focuses the force from a surface onto adjacent discrete forcels
(force sensing cells) by way of protrusions (small bumps or pegs), allowing for
high-accuracy interpolation between adjacent discrete forcels. MFR works with
any force transducing technique or material, including force variable resistive
inks, piezoelectric materials and capacitive force plates. MFR sensors can be
tiled such that the signal is continuous across contiguous tiles. By minimizing
active materials and computational complexity, MFR makes large-format
interactive walls, collaborative tabletops and high-resolution floor tiles
possible and economically feasible.

%X The advent of ultra-high resolution wall-size displays and their use for
complex tasks require a more systematic analysis and deeper understanding of
their advantages and drawbacks compared with desktop monitors. While previous
work has mostly addressed search, visualization and sense-making tasks, we have
designed an abstract classification task that involves explicit data
manipulation. Based on our observations of real uses of a wall display, this
task represents a large category of applications. We report on a controlled
experiment that uses this task to compare physical navigation in front of a
wall-size display with virtual navigation using pan-and-zoom on the desktop.
Our main finding is a robust interaction effect between display type and task
difficulty: while the desktop can be faster than the wall for simple tasks, the
wall gains a sizable advantage as the task becomes more difficult. A follow-up
study shows that other desktop techniques (overview+detail, lens) do not
perform better than pan-and-zoom and are therefore slower than the wall for
difficult tasks.

%X This paper extends research on the giving and inheriting of digital
artifacts by examining social network site accounts post-mortem. Given the
important role that social network sites play in online bereavement practices,
we conducted a series of in-depth qualitative interviews to explore issues
around inheritance and post-mortem data management of Facebook accounts. We
found that participants focused less on ownership of the data, and instead on
the duties and potential conflicts associated with maintaining an account
post-mortem. Subsequently, we argue for 'stewardship' as an alternative to
inheritance for framing post-mortem data management practices. Analysis of
post-mortem data management activities highlights how stewards are accountable
and responsible to the deceased and various survivors. However, weighing
competing responsibilities is complicated by varied relationships with
disparate survivors, as well as the inability to consult with the deceased.
Based on our findings, we claim that post-mortem solutions need to account for
the needs of stewards in addition to those of the deceased and survivors. We
suggest that a model of stewardship better accounts for the interpersonal
responsibilities that accompany online data than inheritance alone.

%X In this paper we examine the use of a novel social technology to support the
provision of formal aged care services to clients who live in their own homes.
Social technologies offer enormous potential for enhancing aged care, but
research on their use in aged care has largely focused on institutional or
informal care settings, rather than formal care in the home. Meanwhile,
technologies for aging in place typically focus on monitoring and security,
rather than psychosocial support. We conducted a field study in which aged care
managers used a photo and message-sharing tool to communicate with clients
living in their own homes. Our findings demonstrate that visual and social
forms of communication are valuable for supporting psychosocial care-giving,
but there are barriers to effectively adopting new communication tools in this
setting. Time constraints inhibited care managers' use of the technology, which
was also influenced by their efforts to carefully maintain boundaries between
their personal and professional lives.

%X A variety of systems have been designed to support communication between
distance-separated grandparents and grandchildren. Yet there are few studies of
the actual conversational routines of these groups as well as the social
challenges that might arise as a result of technology usage. To address this
gap, we conducted an interview and diary study that explores the conversational
practices of distance-separated grandparents and young grandchildren (aged
3-10) from the perspective of the grandparents and parents of the children. Our
results describe the focus of grandparent-grandchild conversations and show
that grandparent-grandchild communication is not without its challenges:
grandparents sometimes feel self-conscious, perceive that parents or children
will be annoyed if they ask too many questions, and do not want to interfere
too much in their grandchildren's lives. The implication is that designs should
attempt to support the conversation routines and needs of grandparents and
grandchildren while attempting to mitigate the social challenges.

%X Scientists debate whether people grow closer to their friends through social
networking sites like Facebook, whether those sites displace more meaningful
interaction, or whether they simply reflect existing ties. Combining server log
analysis and longitudinal surveys of 3,649 Facebook users reporting on
relationships with 26,134 friends, we find that communication on the site is
associated with changes in reported relationship closeness, over and above
effects attributable to their face-to-face, phone, and email contact. Tie
strength increases with both one-on-one communication, such as posts, comments,
and messages, and through reading friends' broadcasted content, such as status
updates and photos. The effect is greater for composed pieces, such as
comments, posts, and messages than for 'one-click' actions such as 'likes.'
Facebook has a greater impact on non-family relationships and ties who do not
frequently communicate via other channels.
