%X This research measures human performance in inferring the functional types
(i.e., home, work, leisure and transport) of locations in geo-location data
using different visual representations of the data (textual, static and
animated visualizations) along with different amounts of data (1, 3 or 5
day(s)). We first collected real life geo-location data from tweets. We then
asked the data owners to tag their location points, resulting in ground truth
data. Using this dataset we conducted an empirical study involving 45
participants to analyze how accurately they could infer the functional location
of the original data owners under different conditions, i.e., three data
representations, three data densities and four location types. The study
results indicate that while visual techniques perform better than textual ones,
the functional locations of human activities can be inferred with a relatively
high accuracy even using only textual representations and a low density of
location points. Workplace was more easily inferred than home while transport
was the functional location with the highest accuracy. Our results also showed
that it was easier to infer functional locations from data exhibiting more
stable and consistent mobility patterns, which are thus more vulnerable to
privacy disclosures. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context
of privacy preservation and provide guidelines to users and companies to help
preserve and safeguard people's privacy.

%X Wikipedia articles about places, OpenStreetMap features, and other forms of
peer-produced content have become critical sources of geographic knowledge for
humans and intelligent technologies. In this paper, we explore the
effectiveness of the peer production model across the rural/urban divide, a
divide that has been shown to be an important factor in many online social
systems. We find that in both Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap, peer-produced
content about rural areas is of systematically lower quality, is less likely to
have been produced by contributors who focus on the local area, and is more
likely to have been generated by automated software agents (i.e. "bots"). We
then codify the systemic challenges inherent to characterizing rural phenomena
through peer production and discuss potential solutions.

%X There is an increasing demand to encourage inclusivity in the design of
digital services. In response to this issue we have created App Movement, a
platform that enables the promotion, collaborative design, and deployment of
community-commissioned mobile applications. The platform facilitates
collaborative customization of a common app template, for which the development
and deployment of the app is fully automated. We describe the motivation,
design and implementation of App Movement, and report the findings from an 8
month deployment wherein 27 campaigns were created, 11 of which have been
successful, and over 1,600 users pledged their support using the platform. We
present three case studies to demonstrate its use and adoption in successful
and unsuccessful campaigns. We discuss the implications of these studies,
including questions of governance (ownership of content, liability of user
generated content and moderation), sustainability and the potential to extend
App Movement beyond location-based review apps.

%X Distances and areas frequently appear in text articles. However, people
struggle to understand these measurements when they cannot relate them to
measurements of locations that they are personally familiar with. We contribute
tools for generating personalized spatial analogies: re-expressions that
contextualize spatial measurements in terms of locations with similar
measurements that are more familiar to the user. Our automated approach takes a
user's location and generates a personalized spatial analogy for a target
distance or area using landmarks. We present an interactive application that
tags distances, areas, and locations in a text article and presents
personalized spatial analogies using interactive maps. We find that users who
view a personalized spatial analogy map generated by our system rate the
helpfulness of the information for understanding a distance or area 1.9 points
higher (on a 7 pt scale) than when they see the article with no spatial analogy
and 0.7 points higher than when they see generic spatial analogy.

%X Despite of a significant body of research in optimizing the virtual keyboard
layout, none of them has gained large adoption, primarily due to the steep
learning curve. To address this learning problem, we introduced three types of
Qwerty constraints, Qwerty1, QwertyH1, and One-Swap bounds in layout
optimization, and investigated their effects on layout learnability and
performance. This bounded optimization process leads to IJQwerty, which has
only one pair of keys different from Qwerty. Our theoretical analysis and user
study show that IJQwerty improves the accuracy and input speed of gesture
typing over Qwerty once a user reaches the expert mode. IJQwerty is also
extremely easy to learn. The initial upon-use text entry speed is the same with
Qwerty. Given the high performance and learnability, such a layout will more
likely gain large adoption than any of previously obtained layouts. Our
research also shows the disparity from Qwerty substantially affects layout
learning. To minimize the learning effort, a new layout needs to hold a strong
resemblance to Qwerty.

%X Fast and accurate access to keys for text entry remains an open question for
miniature screens. Existing works typically use a cumbersome two-step selection
process, first to zero-in on a particular zone and second to make the key
selection. We introduce DualKey, a miniature screen text entry technique with a
single selection step that relies on finger identification. We report on the
results of a 10 day longitudinal study with 10 participants that evaluated
speed, accuracy, and learning. DualKey outperformed the existing techniques on
long-term performance with a speed of 19.6 WPM. We then optimized the keyboard
layout for reducing finger switching time based on the study data. A second 10
day study with eight participants showed that the new sweqty layout improved
upon DualKey even further to 21.59 WPM for long-term speed, was comparable to
existing techniques on novice speed and outperformed existing techniques on
novice accuracy rate.

%X We present 1D Handwriting, a unistroke gesture technique enabling text entry
on a one-dimensional interface. The challenge is to map two-dimensional
handwriting to a reduced one-dimensional space, while achieving a balance
between memorability and performance efficiency. After an iterative design, we
finally derive a set of ambiguous two-length unistroke gestures, each mapping
to 1-4 letters. To input words, we design a Bayesian algorithm that takes into
account the probability of gestures and the language model. To input letters,
we design a pause gesture allowing users to switch into letter selection mode
seamlessly. Users studies show that 1D Handwriting significantly outperforms a
selection-based technique (a variation of 1Line Keyboard) for both letter input
(4.67 WPM vs. 4.20 WPM) and word input (9.72 WPM vs. 8.10 WPM). With extensive
training, text entry rate can reach 19.6 WPM. Users' subjective feedback
indicates 1D Handwriting is easy to learn and efficient to use. Moreover, it
has several potential applications for other one-dimensional constrained
interfaces.

%X Mobile keyboards often present error corrections and word completions
(suggestions) as candidates for anticipated user input. However, these
suggestions are not cognitively free: they require users to attend, evaluate,
and act upon them. To understand this trade-off between suggestion savings and
interaction costs, we conducted a text transcription experiment that controlled
interface assertiveness: the tendency for an interface to present itself.
Suggestions were either always present (extraverted), never present
(introverted), or gated by a probability threshold (ambiverted). Results showed
that although increasing the assertiveness of suggestions reduced the number of
keyboard actions to enter text and was subjectively preferred, the costs of
attending to and using the suggestions impaired average time performance.

%X Many existing studies of social media focus on only one platform, but the
reality of users' lived experiences is that most users incorporate multiple
platforms into their communication practices in order to access the people and
networks they desire to influence. In order to better understand how people
make sharing decisions across multiple sites, we asked our participants (N=29)
to categorize all modes of communication they used, with the goal of surfacing
their mental models about managing sharing across platforms. Our interview data
suggest that people simultaneously consider "audience" and "content" when
sharing and these needs sometimes compete with one another; that they have the
strong desire to both maintain boundaries between platforms as well as allowing
content and audience to permeate across these boundaries; and that they strive
to stabilize their own communication ecosystem yet need to respond to changes
necessitated by the emergence of new tools, practices, and contacts. We unpack
the implications of these tensions and suggest future design possibilities.

We use an interview- and diary-based study to explore: 1) what factors impact
channel choice for sharing with particular audiences; and 2) what behavioral
patterns emerge from the ability to combine or switch between channels. We find
that in the context of different tasks, participants match channel features to
selective-sharing and other task-based needs, shaped by recipient attributes
and communication dynamics. Participants also combine multiple channels to
create composite sharing features or reach broader audiences when one channel
is insufficient. We discuss design implications of these channel dynamics.

choosing what to share and with whom. Sharing with others invites certain
risks, as well as potential benefits; achieving the right balance is even more
critical when sharing photos, which can be particularly engaging, but
potentially compromising. In this paper, we examine photo-sharing decisions as
an interaction between high-level user preferences and specific features of the
images being shared. Our analysis combines insights from a 96-user survey with
metadata from 10.4M photos to develop a model integrating these perspectives to
predict permissions settings for uploaded photos. We discuss implications,
including how such a model can be applied to provide online sharing experiences
that are more safe, more scalable, and more satisfying.

%X People often try to impress their friends online, but we don't know how well
they do it or what they talk about to try to make themselves look good. In the
face of known egocentric biases, which cause communicators to overestimate the
extent that audiences will understand the intent of their messages, and
self-enhancement biases, that cause people to overvalue their own behavior, it
is likely that many self-presentation attempts will often fail. However, we
don't know which topics cause such failure. In an empirical study, 1300
Facebook users evaluated their most recent status update in terms of how good
it make them look. In addition external judges also evaluated the same update.
Posters and outsiders agreed only modestly about how good an update made the
poster appear (r=.36, p&lt;.001). Posters generally thought that their posts
make them look better than did the outsider judges. They also disagreed on
which topics made them look good. Posters were especially likely to
overestimate their self-presentation when they wrote about the mundane details
of their daily life (e.g., Clothing, Sleep, or Religious imagery), but
underestimated it when they wrote about family and relationships (e.g.,
Birthday, Father's Day, Love).

children with autism in a participatory design process to develop their own
smart object. We re-interpreted Future Workshops and Co-operative Inquiry to
demonstrate that a) autistic children can lead processes with a deliberately
open design brief and b) this leads us to explore design spaces that are
un-imaginable for neuro-typical, adult designers. To capture these four design
cases, we have developed Design Exposes, a concept that is inspired by
annotated portfolios and Actor-Network Theory. We apply this concept to our
cases and present four exposes that subsequently allow us to draw out
intermediate-level design knowledge about co-creating technology with autistic
children. We close by critically reflecting on the design processes as well as
our concept of capturing them.

%X Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by unusual social
communication and interaction. These traits are often targets for intervention,
particularly computer-based interventions (CBIs). We examined whether
interactive behaviors in children with autism could be influenced by modifying
the facial characteristics of computer avatars and how behavior toward avatars
compared to that toward video. Participants spoke with a therapist over a
modified videoconferencing system that permitted manipulation of her appearance
(i.e., using cartoon or more realistic avatars versus video) and motion (i.e.,
exaggerating or damping facial movements). We measured the participants'
speech, gaze, and gestures. In the first study, we found that the appearance
complexity of the avatar did not significantly affect any social interaction
behaviors. However, the results of the second study suggest that exaggerated
facial motion can improve nonverbal social behaviors, such as gaze and gesture.
These findings have implications for character design in CBIs for ASD.

Through a design process involving domain professionals and families we
designed MOBERO, a smartphone-based system that assists families in
establishing healthy morning and bedtime routines with the aim to assist the
child in becoming independent and lowering the parents' frustration levels. In
a two-week intervention with 13 children with ADHD and their families, MOBERO
significantly improved children's independence and reduced parents' frustration
levels. Additionally, use of MOBERO was associated with a 16.5% reduction in
core ADHD symptoms and an 8.3% improvement in the child's sleep habits, both
measured by standardized questionnaires. Our study highlights the potential of
assistive technologies to change the everyday practices of families of children
with ADHD.

in his or her life. In this work, we investigate how interactive technology
design features support children with and without disabilities with inclusion
during play. We developed four versions of Incloodle, a two-player
picture-taking tablet application, designed to be inclusive of children with
different abilities and needs. Each version of the application varied in (1)
whether or not it enforced co-operation between children; and in (2) whether it
prompted interactions through in-app characters or more basic instructions. A
laboratory study revealed technology-enforced cooperation was helpful for child
pairs who needed scaffolding, but character-based prompting had little effect
on children's experiences. We provide an empirical evaluation of interactive
technology for inclusive play and offer guidance for designing technology that
facilitates inclusive play between young neurotypical and neurodiverse
children.

%X Most modern stereoscopic 3D applications use fixed stereoscopic 3D
parameters (separation and convergence) to render the scene on a 3D display.
But, keeping these parameters fixed during usage does not always provide the
best experience since it can reduce the amount of depth perception possible in
some applications which have large variability in object distances. We
developed two stereoscopic rendering techniques which actively vary the stereo
parameters based on the scene content. Our first algorithm calculates a low
resolution depth map of the scene and chooses ideal stereo parameters based on
that depth map. Our second algorithm uses eye tracking data to get the gaze
direction of the user and chooses ideal stereo parameters based on the distance
of the gazed object. We evaluated our techniques in an experiment that uses
three depth judgment tasks: depth ranking, relative depth judgment and path
tracing. Our results indicate that variable stereo parameters provide enhanced
depth discrimination compared to static parameters and were preferred by our
participants over the traditional fixed parameter approach. We discuss our
findings and possible implications on the design of future stereoscopic 3D
applications.

%X An important visual cue for the distance to a target is its binocular depth,
the disparity between the left and right eyes. We examined mid-air pointing on
a large screen, varying the physical distances (depths) to targets. Welford's
two-part formulation provided a better model than the one-part Fitts's Law
formulation to predict movement time from movement amplitude and target width.
Angular measures suggested by Kopper et al. did not improve the model.
Consistent variations of Shoemaker et al.'s k-factor suggest target depth plays
a role similar to gain for mid-air pointing. We compared both physical and
virtual targets to determine if artificial binocular depth cues induce the same
performance as purely physical binocular depth cues. Variation of the k-factor
was different when virtual depth and physical depth were not identical. This
has implications for calibrating 3-D virtual environments and for the design of
interactive 3-D pointing techniques for those environments.

%X A key requirement for a sense of presence in Virtual Environments (VEs) is
for a user to perceive space as naturally as possible. One critical aspect is
distance perception. When judging distances, compression is a phenomenon where
humans tend to underestimate the distance between themselves and target objects
(termed egocentric or absolute compression), and between other objects
(exocentric or relative compression). Results of studies in virtual worlds
rendered through head mounted displays are striking, demonstrating significant
distance compression error. Distance compression is a multisensory phenomenon,
where both audio and visual stimuli are often compressed with respect to their
distances from the observer. In this paper, we propose and test a method for
reducing crossmodal distance compression in VEs. We report an empirical
evaluation of our method via a study of 3D spatial perception within a virtual
reality (VR) head mounted display. Applying our method resulted in more
accurate distance perception in a VE at longer range, and suggests a
modification that could adaptively compensate for distance compression at both
shorter and longer ranges. Our results have a significant and intriguing
implication for designers of VEs: an incongruent audiovisual display, i.e.
where the audio and visual information is intentionally misaligned, may lead to
better spatial perception of a virtual scene.

%X Recently, it has become common for designers to deal with complex and
large-scale ubicomp or IoT spaces. Designers without technical implementation
skills have difficulties in prototyping such spaces, especially in the early
phases of design. We present miniStudio, a designers' tool for prototyping
ubicomp space with proxemic interactions. It is built on designers' existing
software and modeling materials (Photoshop, Lego, and paper). Interactions can
be defined in Photoshop based on five spatial relations: location, distance,
motion, orientation, and custom. Projection-based augmented reality was applied
to miniatures in order to enable tangible interactions and dynamic
representations. Hidden marker stickers and a camera-projector system enable
the unobtrusive integration of digital images on the physical miniature.
Through the user study with 12 designers and researchers in the ubicomp field,
we found that miniStudio supported rapid prototyping of large and complex ideas
with multiple connected components. Based on the tool development and the
study, we discuss the implications for prototyping ubicomp environments in the
early phase of the design.

%X Online services are increasingly dependent on user participation. Whether
it's online social networks or crowdsourcing services, understanding user
behavior is important yet challenging. In this paper, we build an unsupervised
system to capture dominating user behaviors from clickstream data (traces of
users' click events), and visualize the detected behaviors in an intuitive
manner. Our system identifies "clusters" of similar users by partitioning a
similarity graph (nodes are users; edges are weighted by clickstream
similarity). The partitioning process leverages iterative feature pruning to
capture the natural hierarchy within user clusters and produce intuitive
features for visualizing and understanding captured user behaviors. For
evaluation, we present case studies on two large-scale clickstream traces (142
million events) from real social networks. Our system effectively identifies
previously unknown behaviors, e.g., dormant users, hostile chatters. Also, our
user study shows people can easily interpret identified behaviors using our
visualization tool.

%X From smart homes that prepare coffee when we wake, to phones that know not
to interrupt us during important conversations, our collective visions of HCI
imagine a future in which computers understand a broad range of human
behaviors. Today our systems fall short of these visions, however, because this
range of behaviors is too large for designers or programmers to capture
manually. In this paper, we instead demonstrate it is possible to mine a broad
knowledge base of human behavior by analyzing more than one billion words of
modern fiction. Our resulting knowledge base, Augur, trains vector models that
can predict many thousands of user activities from surrounding objects in
modern contexts: for example, whether a user may be eating food, meeting with a
friend, or taking a selfie. Augur uses these predictions to identify actions
that people commonly take on objects in the world and estimate a user's future
activities given their current situation. We demonstrate Augur-powered,
activity-based systems such as a phone that silences itself when the odds of
you answering it are low, and a dynamic music player that adjusts to your
present activity. A field deployment of an Augur-powered wearable camera
resulted in 96% recall and 71% precision on its unsupervised predictions of
common daily activities. A second evaluation where human judges rated the
system's predictions over a broad set of input images found that 94% were rated
sensible.

%X Human routines are blueprints of behavior, which allow people to accomplish
purposeful repetitive tasks at many levels, ranging from the structure of their
day to how they drive through an intersection. People express their routines
through actions that they perform in the particular situations that triggered
those actions. An ability to model routines and understand the situations in
which they are likely to occur could allow technology to help people improve
their bad habits, inexpert behavior, and other suboptimal routines. However,
existing routine models do not capture the causal relationships between
situations and actions that describe routines. Our main contribution is the
insight that byproducts of an existing activity prediction algorithm can be
used to model those causal relationships in routines. We apply this algorithm
on two example datasets, and show that the modeled routines are meaningful-that
they are predictive of people's actions and that the modeled causal
relationships provide insights about the routines that match findings from
previous research. Our approach offers a generalizable solution to model and
reason about routines.

%X A growing number of domains, including affect recognition and movement
analysis, require a single, real number ground truth label capturing some
property of a video clip. We term this the provision of continuum labels.
Unfortunately, there is often an uncacceptable trade-off between label
consistency and the efficiency of the labelling process with current tools. We
present a novel interaction technique, setwise comparison, which leverages the
intrinsic human capability for consistent relative judgements and the TrueSkill
algorithm to solve this problem. We describe SorTable, a system demonstrating
this technique. We conducted a real-world study where clinicians labelled
videos of patients with multiple sclerosis for the ASSESS MS computer vision
system. In assessing the efficiency-consistency trade-off of setwise versus
pairwise comparison, we demonstrated that not only is setwise comparison more
efficient, but it also elicits more consistent labels. We further consider how
our findings relate to the interactive machine learning literature.

capturing and reflecting on personal computer usage behaviors. TimeAware
employs an ambient widget to promote self-awareness and to lower the feedback
access burden, and web-based information dashboard to visualize people's
detailed computer usage. To examine the effect of framing on individual's
productivity, we designed two versions of TimeAware, each with a different
framing setting-one emphasizing productive activities (positive framing) and
the other emphasizing distracting activities (negative framing), and conducted
an eight-week deployment study (N = 24). We found a significant effect of
framing on participants' productivity: only participants in the negative
framing condition improved their productivity. The ambient widget seemed to
help sustain engagement with data and enhance self-awareness. We discuss how to
leverage framing effects to help people enhance their productivity, and how to
design successful productivity monitoring tool.

%X Numerous studies have tracked people's everyday use of digital devices, but
without consideration of how such data might be of personal interest to the
user. We have developed a personal tracking application that enables users to
automatically monitor their 'screen time' on mobile devices (iOS and Android)
and computers (Mac and Windows). The application interface enables users to
combine screen time data from multiple devices. We trialled the application for
28+ days with 21 users, collecting log data and interviewing each user. We
found that there is interest in personal tracking in this area, but that the
study participants were less interested in quantifying their overall screen
time than in gaining data about their use of specific devices and applications.
We found that personal tracking of device use is desirable for goals including:
increasing productivity, disciplining device use, and cutting down on use.

%X Developing motivational technology to support long-term behavior change is a
challenge. A solution is to incorporate insights from behavior change theory
and design technology to tailor to individual users. We carried out two studies
to investigate whether the processes of change, from the Transtheoretical
Model, can be effectively represented by motivational text messages. We
crowdsourced peer-designed text messages and coded them into categories based
on the processes of change. We evaluated whether people perceived messages
tailored to their stage of change as motivating. We found that crowdsourcing is
an effective method to design motivational messages. Our results indicate that
different messages are perceived as motivating depending on the stage of
behavior change a person is in. However, while motivational messages related to
later stages of change were perceived as motivational for those stages, the
motivational messages related to earlier stages of change were not. This
indicates that a person's stage of change may not be the (only) key factor that
determines behavior change. More individual factors need to be considered to
design effective motivational technology.

%X While we know that persuasive system design matters, we barely understand
when persuasive strategies work and why they only work in some cases. We
propose an approach to systematically understand and design for motivation, by
studying the fundamental building blocks of motivation, according to the theory
of planned behavior (TPB): attitude, subjective norm, and perceived control. We
quantitatively analyzed (N=643) the attitudes, beliefs, and values of mobile
fitness coach users with TPB. Capacity (i.e., perceived ability to exercise)
had the biggest effect on users' motivation. Using individual differences
theory, we identified three distinct user groups, namely followers, hedonists,
and achievers. With insights from semi-structured interviews (N=5) we derive
design implications finding that transformation videos that feature other
users' success stories as well as suggesting an appropriate workout can have
positive effects on perceived capacity. Practitioners and researchers can use
our theory-based mixed-method research design to better understand user
behavior in persuasive applications.

%X Refugees undergoing resettlement in a new country post exile and migration
face disruptive life changes. They rely on a network of individuals in the host
country to help them rebuild their lives and livelihoods. We investigated
whether technology could contribute to minimizing the vulnerabilities
resettling refugees face. We designed Rivrtran, a messaging platform that
provides 'human-in-the-loop' interpretation between individuals who don't share
a common language. We report the findings from the deployment of Rivrtran to
mediate communication between resettling refugee families in the United States
and the American families they are paired with who serve as their mentors. Our
findings suggest that scaffolding communication in such a way provides refugees
one means of accessing diversified help outside their cultural group. Moreover
human-in-the-loop interpretation may help to mitigate the effects of cultural
barriers between those communicating. We establish the notion of designing for
transient use in the development of systems to scaffold communication for
short-term use by resettling refugees.

refugee ANC. Previously identified high utilization of smartphones by the
refugee population offers a particular opportunity for using digital technology
to support access to ANC as well as health advocacy. Our findings revealed a
number of considerations that should be taken into account in the design of
refugee ANC technologies, including: refugee health beliefs and experiences,
literacy levels, refugee perceptions of negative attitudes of healthcare
providers, and hierarchal and familial structures.

%X Interactive Voice Response (IVR) platforms have been widely deployed in
resource-limited settings. These systems tend to afford asynchronous push
interactions, and within the context of health, provide medication reminders,
descriptions of symptoms and tips on self-management. Here, we present the
development of an IVR system for resource-limited settings that enables
real-time, synchronous interaction. Inspired by community radio, and calls for
health systems that are truly local, we developed "Sehat ki Vaani". Sehat ki
Vaani is a real-time IVR platform that enables hosting and participation in
radio chat shows on community-led topics. We deployed Sehat ki Vaani with two
communities in North India on topics related to the management of Type 2
diabetes and maternal health. Our deployments highlight the potential for
synchronous IVR systems to offer community connection and localised sharing of
experience, while also highlighting the complexity of producing, hosting and
participating in radio shows in real time through IVR. We discuss the relative
strengths and weaknesses of synchronous IVR systems, and highlight lessons
learnt for interaction design in this area.

in the developing world by demonstrating a range of informal practices that are
conducted outside of a discrete (intermediary/beneficiary) user-interface
interaction in a given point in time. Further, this paper also demonstrates how
low-literate users may often voluntarily relinquish custody of an information
resource in order to create and maintain intermediation. In this way we
describe a broader conceptualization of intermediated use in the developing
world that needs to take into account the entire sociotechnical workflow. This
is particularly critical when explicitly designing for secondary/beneficiary
users; it considers their specific requirements that often get overlooked while
simultaneously revealing their vulnerabilities within the formal-informal
continuum. We present findings from ethnographic work conducted in India and
Ghana.

releasing the cracked software for free. Despite the lack of economic
incentives and the absence of external laws regulating it, the warez scene has
been able to self-govern and self-organize for more than three decades. Through
a directed content analysis of the subculture's digital traces, the paper
argues that the ludic competition within the warez scene is an institution of
collective action, and can, therefore, be approached as a common-pool resource
(CPR). Subsequently, the paper uses Ostrom's framework of long-enduring
common-pool resource institutions to understand the warez scene's longevity and
ability to govern itself. Theoretical and design implications of these findings
are then discussed.

%X Interest in understanding and facilitating 3D digital fabrication is growing
in the HCI research community. However, most of our insights about end-user
interaction with fabrication are currently based on interactions of
professional users, makers, and technology enthusiasts. We present a study of
casual makers, users who have no prior experience with fabrication and mainly
explore walk-up-and-use 3D printing services at public print centers, such as
libraries, universities, and schools. We carried out 32 interviews with casual
makers, print center operators, and fabrication experts to understand the
motivations, workflows, and barriers in appropriating 3D printing technologies.
Our results suggest that casual makers are deeply dependent on print center
operators throughout the process from bootstrapping their 3D printing workflow,
to seeking help and troubleshooting, to verifying their outputs. However, print
center operators are usually not trained domain experts in fabrication and
cannot always address the nuanced needs of casual makers. We discuss
implications for optimizing 3D design tools and interactions that can better
facilitate casual makers' workflows.

%X We are interested in how to create digital tools to support informal
sketching and prototyping of physical objects by novices. Achieving this goal
first requires a deeper understanding of how non-professional designers
generate, explore, and communicate design ideas with traditional tools, i.e.,
sketches on paper and hands-on prototyping materials. We describe a study
framed around two all-day design charrettes where participants perform a
complete design process: ideation sketching, concept development and
presentation, fabrication planning documentation and collaborative fabrication
of hand-crafted prototypes. This structure allows us to control key aspects of
the design process while collecting rich data about creative tasks, including
sketches on paper, physical models, and videos of collaboration discussions.
Participants used a variety of drawing techniques to convey 3D concepts. They
also extensively manipulated physical materials, such as paper, foam, and
cardboard, both to support concept exploration and communication with design
partners. Based on these observations, we propose design guidelines for CAD
tools targeted at novice crafters.

allows non-experts to retrofit physical interfaces. Our approach allows for
changing the layout and behavior of physical interfaces. Unlike customizing
software interfaces, physical interfaces are often challenging to adapt because
of their rigidity. With RetroFab, a new physical interface is designed that
serves as a proxy interface for the legacy controls that are now operated by
actuators. RetroFab makes this concept of retrofitting devices available to
non-experts by automatically generating an enclosure structure from an
annotated 3D scan. This enclosure structure holds together actuators, sensors
as well as components for the redesigned interface. To allow retrofitting a
wide variety of legacy devices, the RetroFab design tool comes with a toolkit
of 12 components. We demonstrate the versatility and novel opportunities of our
approach by retrofitting five domestic objects and exploring their use cases.

printed, it is very hard for end-users to customize a 3D-printed object to
their specific needs after it is printed. We propose HotFlex: a new approach
allowing precisely located parts of a 3D object to transition on demand from a
solid into a deformable state and back. This approach enables intuitive
hands-on remodeling, personalization, and customization of a 3D object after it
is printed. We introduce the approach and present an implementation based on
computer-controlled printed heating elements that are embedded within the 3D
object. We present a set of functional patterns that act as building blocks and
enable various forms of hands-on customization. Furthermore, we demonstrate how
to integrate sensing of user input and visual output. A series of technical
experiments and various application examples demonstrate the practical
feasibility of the approach.

question, we developed four APAs with two distinct personality types and two
sets of gestures expressing distinct emotional feedback. Effects of APAs'
personality types and emotional feedback strategies on learning experiences and
performance were assessed experimentally using a virtual Tai Chi training
system. Fifty six participants completed the experiment. Results showed that
positive emotional feedback strategy led to better learning experiences and
performance than negative feedback strategy. Moreover, personality type had
significant effect on learning. Choleric APAs led to better performance than
Phlegmatic APAs. Personality types moderated the effect of emotional feedback
on learning satisfaction. Our study demonstrates that APAs with distinct
personality types and emotional feedback are important design parameters for
virtual learning environments.

%X Peer assessment is rapidly growing in online learning, as it presents a
method to address scalability challenges. However, research suggests that the
benefits of peer review are obtained inconsistently. This paper explores why,
introducing three ways that framing task goals significantly changes reviews.
Three experiments manipulated features in the review environment. First, adding
a numeric scale to open text reviews was found to elicit more explanatory, but
lower quality reviews. Second, structuring a review task into short, chunked
stages elicited more diverse feedback. Finally, showing reviewers a draft along
with finished work elicited reviews that focused more on the work's goals than
aesthetic details. These findings demonstrate the importance of carefully
structuring online learning environments to ensure high quality peer reviews.

%X The Internet has enabled learning at scale, from Massive Open Online Courses
(MOOCs) to Wikipedia. But online learners may become passive, instead of
actively constructing knowledge and revising their beliefs in light of new
facts. Instructors cannot directly diagnose thousands of learners'
misconceptions and provide remedial tutoring. This paper investigates how
instructors can prompt learners to reflect on facts that are anomalies with
respect to their existing misconceptions, and how to choose these anomalies and
prompts to guide learners to revise incorrect beliefs without any feedback. We
conducted two randomized experiments with online crowd workers learning
statistics. Results show that prompts to explain why these anomalies are true
drive revision towards correct beliefs. But prompts to simply articulate
thoughts about anomalies have no effect on learning. Furthermore, we find that
explaining multiple anomalies is more effective than explaining only one, but
the anomalies should rule out multiple misconceptions simultaneously.

%X So many people are now using handheld second screens whilst watching TV that
application developers and broadcasters are designing companion applications
Second screen content that accompanies a TV programme. The nature of such
dual-screen use cases inherently causes attention to be split, somewhat
unpredictably. Dual-screen complexity, a clear factor in this attention split,
is largely unexplored by the literature and will have an unknown (and likely
negative) impact on user experience (UX). Therefore, we use empirical
techniques to investigate the objective and subjective effect of dual-screen
visual complexity on attention distribution in a companion content scenario.
Our sequence of studies culminates in the deployment of a companion application
prototype that supports adjustment of complexity (by either content curator or
viewer) to allow convergence on optimum experience. Our findings assist the
effective design of dual-screen content, informing content providers how to
manage dual second screen complexity for enhanced UX through a more blended,
complementary dual-screen experience.

%X In this paper, we set out to find what encompasses an appropriate visual
language for information presented on near-eye out-of-focus displays. These
displays are positioned in a user's peripheral view, very near to the user's
eyes, for example on the inside of the temples of a pair of glasses. We
explored the usable display area, the role of spatial and retinal variables,
and the influence of motion and interaction for such a language. Our findings
show that a usable visual language can be accomplished by limiting the possible
shapes and by making clever use of orientation and meaningful motion. We found
that especially motion is very important to improve perception and
comprehension of what is being displayed on near-eye out-of-focus displays, and
that perception is further improved if direct interaction with the content is
allowed.

%X Emerging technologies allow for the creation of non-rectangular displays
with unlimited constraints in shape. However, the introduction of such displays
radically deviates from the prevailing tradition of placing content on
rectangular screens and raises fundamental design questions. Among these is the
foremost question of how to legibly present text. We address this fundamental
concern through a multi-part exploration that includes: (1) a focus-group study
from which we collected free-form display scenarios and extracted display shape
properties; (2) a framework that identifies different mappings of text onto a
non-rectangular shape and formulates hypotheses concerning legibility for
different display shape properties; and (3) a series of quantitative text
legibility studies to assess our hypotheses. Or results agree with and extend
upon other findings in the existing literature on text legibility, but they
also uncover unique instances in which different rules need to be applied for
non-rectangular displays. These results also provide guidelines for the design
of visual interfaces.

%X Our eyes use multiple cues to perceive depth. Current 3D displays do not
support all depth cues humans can perceive. While they support binocular
disparity and convergence, no commercially available 3D display supports focus
cues. To use them requires accommodation, i.e. stretching the eye lens when
focusing on an individual distance. Previous work proposed multilayer and light
field displays that require the eye to accommodate. Such displays enable the
user to focus on different depths and blur out content that is out of focus.
Thereby, they might ease the separation of content displayed on different depth
layers. In this paper we investigate the effect of focus cues by comparing 3D
shutter glasses with a multilayer display. We show that recognizing content
displayed on a multilayer display takes less time and results in fewer errors
compared to shutter glasses. We further show that separating overlapping
content on multilayer displays again takes less time, results in fewer errors,
and is less demanding. Hence, we argue that multilayer displays are superior to
standard 3D displays if layered 3D content is displayed, and they have the
potential to extend the design space of standard GUI.

%X Geotagged tweets and other forms of social media volunteered geographic
information (VGI) are becoming increasingly critical to many applications and
scientific studies. An important assumption underlying much of this research is
that social media VGI is "local", or that its geotags correspond closely with
the general home locations of its contributors. We demonstrate through a study
on three separate social media communities (Twitter, Flickr, Swarm) that this
localness assumption holds in only about 75% of cases. In addition, we show
that the geographic contours of localness follow important sociodemographic
trends, with social media in, for instance, rural areas and older areas, being
substantially less local in character (when controlling for other
demographics). We demonstrate through a case study that failure to account for
non-local social media VGI can lead to misrepresentative results in social
media VGI-based studies. Finally, we compare the methods for determining
localness, finding substantial disagreement in certain cases, and highlight new
best practices for social media VGI-based studies and systems.

memorable text passwords. However, this research has generally been in the
context of desktops and laptops, while users are increasingly creating and
entering passwords on mobile devices. In this paper we study whether recent
password guidance carries over to the mobile setting. We compare the strength
and usability of passwords created and used on mobile devices with those
created and used on desktops and laptops, while varying password policy
requirements and input methods. We find that creating passwords on mobile
devices takes significantly longer and is more error prone and frustrating.
Passwords created on mobile devices are also weaker, but only against attackers
who can make more than 10^13 guesses. We find that the effects of password
policies differ between the desktop and mobile environments, and suggest ways
to ease password entry for mobile users.

%X Mobile application phishing happens when a malicious mobile application
masquerades as a legitimate one to steal user credentials. Personalized
security indicators may help users to detect phishing attacks, but rely on the
user's alertness. Previous studies in the context of website phishing have
shown that users tend to ignore personalized security indicators and fall
victim to attacks despite their deployment. Consequently, the research
community has deemed personalized security indicators an ineffective phishing
detection mechanism. We revisit the question of personalized security indicator
effectiveness and evaluate them in the previously unexplored and increasingly
important context of mobile applications. We conducted a user study with 221
participants and found that the deployment of personalized security indicators
decreased the phishing attack success rate to 50%. Personalized security
indicators can, therefore, help phishing detection in mobile applications and
their reputation as an anti-phishing mechanism in the mobile context should be
reconsidered.

%X Deception is typically regarded as a morally impoverished choice. However,
in the context of increasingly intimate, connected and ramified systems of
online interaction, manipulating information in ways that could be considered
deceptive is often necessary, useful, and even morally justifiable. In this
study, we apply a speculative design approach to explore the idea of tools that
assist in pro-social forms of online deception, such as those that conceal,
distort, falsify and omit information in ways that promote sociality. In
one-on-one semi-structured interviews, we asked 15 participants to respond to a
selection of speculations, consisting of imagined tools that reify particular
approaches to deception. Participants reflected upon potential practical,
ethical, and social implications of the use of such tools, revealing a variety
of ways such tools might one day encourage polite behaviour, support individual
autonomy, provide a defence against privacy intrusions, navigate social status
asymmetries, and even promote more open, honest behaviour.

%X The asynchronous nature of communications on social network sites creates a
unique opportunity for studying how posting content interacts with individuals'
engagement. This study focuses on the behavioral changes occurring hours before
and after contribution to better understand the changing needs and preferences
of contributors. Using observational data analysis of individuals' activity on
Facebook, we test hypotheses regarding the motivations for site visits, changes
in the distribution of attention to content, and shifts in decisions to
interact with others. We find that after posting content people are
intrinsically motivated to visit the site more often, are more attentive to
content from friends (but not others), and choose to interact more with friends
(in large part due to reciprocity). In addition, contributors are more active
on the site hours before posting and remain more active for less than a day
afterwards. Our study identifies a unique pattern of engagement that
accompanies contribution and can inform the design of social network sites to
better support contributors.

%X Animated GIFs have been around since 1987 and recently gained more
popularity on social networking sites. Tumblr, a large social networking and
micro blogging platform, is a popular venue to share animated GIFs. Tumblr
users follow blogs, generating a feed or posts, and choose to "like' or to
"reblog' favored posts. In this paper, we use these actions as signals to
analyze the engagement of over 3.9 million posts, and conclude that animated
GIFs are significantly more engaging than other kinds of media. We follow this
finding with deeper visual analysis of nearly 100k animated GIFs and pair our
results with interviews with 13 Tumblr users to find out what makes animated
GIFs engaging. We found that the animation, lack of sound, immediacy of
consumption, low bandwidth and minimal time demands, the storytelling
capabilities and utility for expressing emotions were significant factors in
making GIFs the most engaging content on Tumblr. We also found that engaging
GIFs contained faces and had higher motion energy, uniformity, resolution and
frame rate. Our findings connect to media theories and have implications in
design of effective content dashboards, video summarization tools and ranking
algorithms to enhance engagement.

%X Nudging behaviors through user interface design is a practice that is
well-studied in HCI research. Corporations often use this knowledge to modify
online interfaces to influence user information disclosure. In this paper, we
experimentally test the impact of a norm-shaping design patterns on information
divulging behavior. We show that (1) a set of images, biased toward more
revealing figures, change subjects' personal views of appropriate information
to share; (2) that shifts in perceptions significantly increases the
probability that a subject divulges personal information; and (3) that these
shift also increases the probability that the subject advises others to do so.
Our main contribution is empirically identifying a key mechanism by which
norm-shaping designs can change beliefs and subsequent disclosure behaviors.

%X Friendsourcing consists of broadcasting questions and help requests to
friends on social networking sites. Despite its potential value, friendsourcing
requests often fall on deaf ears. One way to improve response rates and
motivate friends to undertake more effortful tasks may be to offer extrinsic
rewards, such as money or a gift, for responding to friendsourcing requests.
However, past research suggests that these extrinsic rewards can have
unintended consequences, including undermining intrinsic motivations and
undercutting the relationship between people. To explore the effects of
extrinsic reward on friends' response rate and perceived relationship, we
conducted an experiment on a new friendsourcing platform -- Mobilyzr. Results
indicate that large extrinsic rewards increase friends' response rates without
reducing the relationship strength between friends. Additionally, the extrinsic
rewards allow requesters to explain away the failure of friendsourcing requests
and thus preserve their perceptions of relationship ties with friends.

%X Increasing numbers of American parents identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual,
or transgender (LGBT). Shifting social movements are beginning to achieve
greater recognition for LGBT parents and more rights for their families;
however, LGBT parents still experience stigma and judgment in a variety of
social contexts. We interviewed 28 LGBT parents to investigate how they
navigate their online environments in light of these societal shifts. We find
that 1) LGBT parents use social media sites to detect disapproval and identify
allies within their social networks; 2) LGBT parents become what we call
incidental advocates, when everyday social media posts are perceived as
advocacy work even when not intended as such; and 3) for LGBT parents, privacy
is a complex and collective responsibility, shared with children, partners, and
families. We consider the complexities of LGBT parents' online disclosures in
the context of shifting social movements and discuss the importance of
supporting individual and collective privacy boundaries in these contexts.

children's out-of-school learning experiences. One might expect that the recent
surge in online educational tools and the vast online network of information
about informal learning would make this easier for all parents. Instead, the
increase in these free, accessible resources is contributing to an inequality
of use between children from lower and higher socio-economic status (SES).
Through over 60 interviews with a diverse group of parents, we explored
parents' ability to find learning opportunities and their role in facilitating
educational experiences for their children. We identified differences in the
use of online social networks in finding learning opportunities for their
children based on SES. Building upon these findings, we conducted a national
survey in partnership with ACT, an educational testing services organization,
to understand if these differences were generalizable to and consistent among a
broader audience.

%X Families are becoming more culturally heterogeneous due to a rise in
intermarriage, geographic mobility, and access to a greater diversity of
cultural perspectives online. Investigating the challenges of cross-cultural
parenting can help us support this growing demographic, as well as better
understand how families integrate and negotiate advice from diverse online and
offline sources in making parenting decisions. We interviewed parents from 18
families to understand the practices they adopt to meet the challenges of
cross-cultural parenting. We investigated how these families respond to
conflicts while integrating diverse cultural views, as well as how they utilize
the wealth of parenting resources available online in navigating these tasks.
We identify five themes focused on how these families find and evaluate advice,
connect with social support, resolve intra-family tensions, incorporate
multicultural practices, and seek out diverse views. Based on our findings, we
contribute three implications for design and translations of these implications
to concrete technology ideas that aim to help families better integrate
multiple cultures into everyday life.

%X Prior work shows that setting limits on young children's screen time is
conducive to healthy development but can be a challenge for families. We
investigate children's (age 1 -- 5) transitions to and from screen-based
activities to understand the boundaries families have set and their experiences
living within them. We report on interviews with 27 parents and a diary study
with a separate 28 families examining these transitions. These families turn on
screens primarily to facilitate parents' independent activities. Parents feel
this is appropriate but self-audit and express hesitation, as they feel they
are benefiting from an activity that can be detrimental to their child's
well-being. We found that families turn off screens when parents are ready to
give their child their full attention and technology presents a natural
stopping point. Transitioning away from screens is often painful, and
predictive factors determine the pain of a transition. Technology-mediated
transitions are significantly more successful than parent-mediated transitions,
suggesting that the design community has the power to make this experience
better for parents and children by creating technologies that facilitate
boundary-setting and respect families' self-defined limits.

%X The increase in the availability of personal genomic data to lay consumers
using online services poses a challenge to HCI researchers: such data are
complex and sensitive, involve multiple dimensions of uncertainty, and can have
substantial implications for individuals' well-being. Personal genomic data are
also unique because unlike other personal data, which constantly change,
genomic data are largely stable during a person's lifetime; it is their
interpretation and implications that change over time as new medical research
exposes relationships between genes and health. In this paper, we present a
novel tool for self exploration of personal genomic data. To evaluate the
usability and utility of the tool, we conducted the first study of a genome
interpretation tool to date, in which users used their own personal genomic
data. We conclude by offering design implications for the development of
interactive personal genomic reports.

"date" other participants. In the rich context of dating, we study how personal
data is used conversationally to communicate and illustrate identity. We note
the manner in which participants carefully curated their profiles, expressing
ambiguity before detail, illustration before accuracy. Our findings proposition
a set of data services and features, each concerned with representing and
curating data in new ways, beyond a focus on purely rational or analytic
relationships with a quantified self. Through this, we build on emerging
interest in "lived informatics" and raise questions about the experience and
social reality of a "data-driven life".

%X Recently, self-tracking devices such as wearable activity trackers have
become more available to end users. While these emerging products are imbued
with new characteristics in terms of human-computer interaction, it is still
unclear how to describe and design for user experience in such devices. In this
paper, we present a three-week field study, which aimed to unfold users'
experience with wearable activity trackers. Drawing from Knapp's model of
interaction stages in interpersonal relationship development, we propose three
stages of relationship development between users and self-tracking devices:
initiation &amp; experimentation, intensifying &amp; integration, and
stagnation &amp; termination. We highlight the challenges in each stage and
design opportunities for future self-tracking devices.

%X Designing to support memory for older individuals is a complex challenge in
human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Past literature on human memory has
mapped processes for recalling past experiences, learning new things,
remembering to carry out future intentions and the importance of attention.
However, the understanding of how older adults perceive forgetting in daily
life remains limited. This paper narrows this gap through a study with older
persons (n=18) living independently using self-reporting and semi-structured
focus groups to explore what they forget, how they react, and what mechanisms
they put in place to recover from and avoid forgetting. Findings include
occurrences of prospective and retrospective memory lapses, conflicting
negative and neutral perceptions, and techniques to manage forgetting.
Participant responses indicate that an awareness of forgetting fosters internal
tensions among older adults, thereby creating opportunities for further design
research, e.g., to defuse and normalise these reactions.

encounter difficulties in self-instruction and need support. Text entry, which
is essential for various applications, is one of the most difficult operations
to master. In this paper, we propose Typing Tutor, an individualized tutoring
system for text entry that detects input stumbles and provides instructions. By
conducting two user studies, we clarify the common difficulties that novice
older adults experience and how skill level is related to input stumbles. Based
on these studies, we develop Typing Tutor to support learning how to enter text
on a smartphone. A two-week evaluation experiment with novice older adults
(65+) showed that Typing Tutor was effective in improving their text entry
proficiency, especially in the initial stage of use.

choose not to participate in technology-based social interventions. We
conducted ethnographically-informed field studies with socially isolated older
adults, who used and evaluated a new iPad application designed to help build
new social connections. In this paper we reflect on how the values and
assumptions guiding the technological intervention were not always shared by
those participating in the evaluation. Drawing on our field notes and
interviews with the older adults who chose to discontinue participation, we use
personas to illustrate the complexities and tensions involved in individual
decisions to not participate. This analysis contributes to HCI research calling
for a more critical perspective on technological interventions. We provide
detailed examples highlighting the complex circumstances of our
non-participants' lives, present a framework that outlines the socio-technical
context of non-participation, and use our findings to promote reflective
practice in HCI research that aims to address complex social issues.

The system combines computer vision and interactive projected graphics for

in a commercial climbing center, where it has been successfully used by
hundreds of climbers, including both children and adults. Our primary
contribution is a novel movement-based game system that can inform the design
of future games and augmented sports. We evaluate ACW based on three user
studies (N=50, N=10, N=10) and further observations and interviews. We
highlight three central themes of how digital augmentation can contribute to a
sport: increasing diversity of movement and challenges, enabling user-created
content in an otherwise risky environment, and enabling procedurally generated
content. We further discuss how ACW represents an underexplored class of
interactive systems, i.e., proximity interaction on wall-sized interactive
surfaces, which presents novel human-computer interaction challenges.

%X We introduce Pmomo (acronym of projection mapping on movable object), a
dynamic projection mapping system that tracks the 6-DOF position of real-world
object, and shades it with virtual 3D contents by projection. The system can
precisely lock the projection on the moving object in real-time, even the one
with complex geometry. Based on depth camera, we developed a novel and robust
tracking method that samples the structure of the object into low-density point
cloud, then performs an adaptive searching scheme for the registration
procedure. As a fully interactive system, our method can handle both internal
and external complex occlusions, and can quickly track back the object even
when losing track. In order to further improve the realism of the projected
virtual textures, our system innovatively culls occlusions away from
projection, which is achieved by a facet-covering method. As a result, the
Pmomo system enables the possibility of new interactive Augmented Reality
applications that require high-quality dynamic projection effect.

%X We propose combining shape-changing interfaces and spatial augmented reality
for extending the space of appearances and interactions of actuated interfaces.
While shape-changing interfaces can dynamically alter the physical appearance
of objects, the integration of spatial augmented reality additionally allows
for dynamically changing objects' optical appearance with high detail. This
way, devices can render currently challenging features such as high frequency
texture or fast motion. We frame this combination in the context of computer
graphics with analogies to established techniques for increasing the realism of
3D objects such as bump mapping. This extensible framework helps us identify
challenges of the two techniques and benefits of their combination. We utilize
our prototype shape-changing device enriched with spatial augmented reality
through projection mapping to demonstrate the concept. We present a novel
mechanical distance-fields algorithm for real-time fitting of mechanically
constrained shape-changing devices to arbitrary 3D graphics. Furthermore, we
present a technique for increasing effective screen real estate for spatial
augmented reality through view-dependent shape change.

%X Interaction design is increasingly merging with designing our everyday
environment. Trialing and evaluating such designs in an ecologically valid way
often requires that they be installed in public space without clearly
communicating their nature as trials. This leads to unaware participation in
what, in fact, is an experimental intervention.
   This article focuses on the ethical considerations that arise from doing,
and studying, interventions in public space, including but not restricted to
interactive installations. It argues that under certain circumstances, such as
when the known risks are low and the intervention presents sufficient support
for avoiding involvement, active participation can be considered implicit
consent. We revisit some example interventions from literature and press to
scrutinize the potential risks and pitfalls associated to unaware
participation.

and tools in the context of workspaces and productivity. Using actor-network
theory and the concept of companionability, both of which emphasize the role of
human and non-human actants in the socio-technical fabrics of everyday life, I
analyze the relationships between people, productivity and technology through
the following themes: embodiment, provenance, insecurity, flow and
companionability. The discussion section develops these themes further through
comparison with rhetoric surrounding the Internet of Things (IoT). By putting
the experiences of craftspeople in conversation with IoT rhetoric, I suggest
several policy interventions for understanding connectivity and inter-device
operability as material, flexible and respectful of human agency.

%X Social computing-or computing in a social context-has largely concerned
itself with understanding social interaction among and between people. This
paper asserts that ignoring material components-including computing itself-as
social actors is a mistake. Computing has its own agenda and agencies, and
including it as a member of the social milieu provides a means of producing
design objects that attend to how technology use can extend beyond merely
amplifying or augmenting human actions. In this paper, we offer examples of
projects that utilize the capacity of object-oriented publics to both analyze
the conditions and consequences around existing publics and engage with matters
of concern inherent to emerging publics. Considering how computing as an actor
contributes to the construction of publics provides insight into the design of
computational systems that address issues. We end by introducing the idea of
the object ecology as a way to coordinate design approaches to computational
publics.

%X Repurposing refers to a broad set of practices, such as recycling or
upcycling, all aiming to make better use of or give new life to physical
materials and artifacts. While these practices have an obvious interest
regarding sustainability issues, they also bring about unique aesthetics and
values that may inspire design beyond sustainability concerns. What if we can
harness these qualities in digital materials? We introduce Delete by Haiku, an
application that transforms old mobile text messages into haiku poems. We
elaborate on how the principles of repurposing -- working on a low budget,
introducing chance and combining the original values with the new ones -- can
inform interaction design in evoking some of these aesthetic values. This
approach changes our views on what constitutes "digital materials" and the
opportunities they offer. We also connect recent debates concerning ownership
of data with discussions in the arts on the "Death of the Author."

discuss, in turn, informed consent, the researcher-participant power
differential, presentation of data in publications, the role of ethical review
boards, and, lastly, corporate-facilitated projects. By pointing to unintended
consequences of regulation and oversimplifications of unresolvable moral
conflicts, we propose these provocations not as guidelines or recommendations
but as instruments for challenging our views on what it means to do ethical
research in HCI. We then suggest an alternative grounded in the sensitivities
of those being studied and based on everyday practice and judgement, rather
than one driven by bureaucratic, legal, or philosophical concerns. In
conclusion, we call for a wider and more practical discussion on ethics within
the community, and suggest that we should be more supportive of low-risk
ethical experimentation to further the field.

traditional stage-based performances with interactive artifacts, for streaming
remote parallel performances and for other device facilitated audience
interaction. Compared to traditional theater, mixed-media performances require
a different type of engagement from the actors and rehearsing is challenging,
as it can be impossible to rehearse with all the functional technology and
interaction. Here, we report experiences from a case study of two mixed-media
performances; we studied the rehearsal practices of two actors who were
performing in two different plays. We describe how the actors practiced
presence during rehearsal in a play where they would be geographically remote,
and we describe the challenges of rehearsing with several remote and
interactive elements. Our study informs the broader aims of interactive and
mixed media performances through addressing critical factors of implementing
technology into rehearsal practices.

%X We present a method for fabricating prototypes of interactive computing
devices from clay sculptures without requiring the designer to be skilled in
CAD software. The method creates a "what you sculpt is what you get" process
that mimics the "what you see is what you get" processes used in interface
design for 2D screens. Our approach uses clay for modeling the basic shape of
the device around 3D printed representations, which we call "blanks", of
physical interaction widgets such as buttons, sliders, knobs and other
electronics. Each blank includes 4 fiducial markers uniquely arranged on a
visible surface. After scanning the sculpture, these fiducial marks allow our
software to identify widget types and locations in the scanned model. The
software then converts the scan into a printable prototype by positioning
mounting surfaces, openings for the controls and a splitting plane for
assembly. Because the blanks fit in the sculpted shape, they will reliably fit
in the interactive prototype. Creating an interactive prototype requires about
30 minutes of human effort for sculpting, and after scanning, involves a single
button click to use the process.

%X Current interactive fabrication tools offer tangible feedback by allowing
users to work directly on the physical model, but they are slow because users
need to participate in the physical instantiation of their designs. In
contrast, CAD software offers powerful tools for 3D modeling but delays access
to the physical workpiece until the end of the design process. In this paper we
propose On-the-Fly Print: a 3D modeling approach that allows the user to design
3D models digitally while having a low-fidelity physical wireframe model
printed in parallel. Our software starts printing features as soon as they are
created and updates the physical model as needed. Users can quickly check the
design in a real usage context by removing the partial physical print from the
printer and replacing it afterwards to continue printing. Digital content
modification can be updated with quick physical correction using a retractable
cutting blade. We present the detailed description of On-the-Fly Print and
showcase several examples designed and printed with our system.

%X Computer-aided design of flat patterns allows designers to prototype
foldable 3D objects made of heterogeneous sheets of material. We found origami
designs are often characterized by pre-synthesized patterns and automated
algorithms. Furthermore, augmenting articulated features to a desired model
requires time-consuming synthesis of interconnected joints. This paper presents
CardBoardiZer, a rapid cardboard based prototyping platform that allows
everyday sculptural 3D models to be easily customized, articulated and folded.
We develop a building platform to allow the designer to 1) import a desired 3D
shape, 2) customize articulated partitions into planar or volumetric foldable
patterns, and 3) define rotational movements between partitions. The system
unfolds the model into 2D crease-cut-slot patterns ready for die-cutting and
folding. In this paper, we developed interactive algorithms and validated the
usability of CardBoardiZer using various 3D models. Furthermore, comparisons
between CardBoardiZer and methods of Autodesk&reg; 123D Make, demonstrated
significantly shorter time-to-prototype and ease of fabrication.

3D modeling as a dynamic art-form by employing 3D animation and dynamic
simulation for the modeling of motion sculptures. Our work is inspired by the
rich history of stylized motion depiction techniques in existing 3D motion
sculptures and 2D comic art. Based on a survey of such techniques, we present
an interface that enables users to rapidly explore and craft a variety of
static 3D motion depiction techniques, including motion lines, multiple
stroboscopic stamps, sweeps and particle systems, using a 3D animated object as
input. In a set of professional and non-professional usage sessions, ChronoFab
was found to be a superior tool for the authoring of motion sculptures,
compared to traditional 3D modeling workflows, reducing task completion times
by 79%.

their advancement. In this paper we present Robo-Tangible Activities for

agent framing, together with a physical robotic agent. We describe its
deployment in a school environment, qualitatively analyzing how teachers chose
to orchestrate its use, the value they saw in it, and the barriers they faced
while organizing the sessions with their students. Based on this analysis, we
extract four recommendations that aid in designing and deploying systems that
make use of affordances that are similar to those of the rTAG system.

one's behalf where video streaming is used to share the class with the remote

participation. Survey results show that people favored "top students" to
represent them where gender and race played a much less important role.
Students also highly valued a proxy who was also taking the class so they could
discuss the course material. In class, students found the setup beneficial and
highly valued the pair-wised learning that it afforded. Despite this, proxies
found it difficult to concentrate in class and to be a surrogate for someone
else at the same time. Together our results highlight the benefits and
challenges with human proxies for classroom attendance and raise a series of
design sensitivities that should be explored as part of future research.

%X Reading Latin poses many difficulties for English speakers, because they are
accustomed to relying on word order to determine the roles of words in a
sentence. In Latin, the grammatical form of a word, and not its position, is
responsible for determining the word's function in a sentence. It has proven
challenging to develop pedagogical techniques that successfully draw students'
attention to the grammar of Latin and that students find engaging enough to
use. Building on some of the most promising prior work in Latin instruction-the
Michigan Latin approach -- and on the insights underlying block-based
programming languages used to teach children the basics of computer science, we
developed Ingenium. Ingenium uses abstract puzzle blocks to communicate
grammatical concepts. Engaging students in grammatical reflection, Ingenium
succeeds when students are able to effectively decipher the meaning of Latin
sentences. We adapted Ingenium to be used for two standard classroom
activities: sentence translations and fill-in-the-blank exercises. We evaluated
Ingenium with 67 novice Latin students in universities across the USA. When
using Ingenium, participants opted to perform more optional exercises,
completed translation exercises with significantly fewer errors related to word
order and errors overall, as well as reported higher levels of engagement and
attention to grammar than when using a traditional text-based interface.

%X Learning a second language is challenging. Becoming fluent requires learning
contextual information about how language should be used as well as word
meanings and grammar. The majority of existing language learning applications
provide only thin context around content. In this paper, we present work in
Crystallize, a language learning game that combines traditional learning
approaches with a situated learning paradigm by integrating a spaced-repetition
system within a language learning roleplaying game. To facilitate long-term
engagement with the game, we added a new quest paradigm, "jobs," that allow a
small amount of design effort to generate a large set of highly-scaffolded
tasks that grow iteratively. A large-scale evaluation of the language learning
game "in the wild" with a diverse set of 186 people revealed that the game was
not only engaging players for extended amounts of time but that players learned
an average of 8.7 words in an average of 40.5 minutes.

%X The concept of gamification is receiving increasing attention, particularly
for its potential to motivate students. However, to date the majority of
studies in the context of education have predominantly focused on University
students. This paper explores how gamification could potentially benefit a
specific student population, children with dyslexia who are transitioning from
primary to secondary school. Two teachers from specialist dyslexia teaching
centres used classDojo, a gamification platform, during their teaching sessions
for one term. We detail how the teachers appropriated the platform in different
ways and how the students discussed classDojo in terms of motivation. These
findings have subsequently informed a set of provisional implications for
gamification distilling opportunities for future pedagogical uses, gamification
design for special education and methodological approaches to how gamification
is studied.

%X As visualizations are increasingly used as a storytelling medium for the
general public, it becomes important to help people learn how to understand
visualizations. Prior studies indicate that interactive multimedia learning
environments can increase the effectiveness of learning [11]. To investigate
the efficacy of the multimedia learning environments for data visualization
education, we compared four online learning approaches 1) baseline (i.e., no
tutorial), 2) static tutorial, 3) video tutorial, and 4) interactive
tutorial-through a crowdsourced user study. We measured participants' learning
outcomes in using parallel coordinates with 18 tasks. Results show that
participants with the interactive condition achieved higher scores than those
with the static and baseline conditions, and reported that they had a more
engaging experience than those with the static condition.

group activities. In this paper, we present Lock n' LoL. This is an application
designed to help users focus on their group activities by allowing group
members to limit their smartphone usage together. In particular, it provides
synchronous social awareness of each other's limiting behavior. This
synchronous social awareness can arouse feelings of connectedness among group
members and can mitigate social vulnerability due to smartphone distraction
(e.g., social exclusion) that often results in poor social experiences. After
following an iterative prototyping process, we conducted a large-scale user
study (n = 976) via real field deployment. The study results revealed how the
participants used Lock n' LoL in their diverse contexts and how Lock n' LoL
helped them to mitigate smartphone distractions.

%X As smartphones increasingly pervade our daily lives, people are ever more
interrupted by alerts and notifications. Using both correlational and
experimental methods, we explored whether such interruptions might be causing
inattention and hyperactivity-symptoms associated with Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) even in people not clinically diagnosed with
ADHD. We recruited a sample of 221 participants from the general population.
For one week, participants were assigned to maximize phone interruptions by
keeping notification alerts on and their phones within their reach/sight.
During another week, participants were assigned to minimize phone interruptions
by keeping alerts off and their phones away. Participants reported higher
levels of inattention and hyperactivity when alerts were on than when alerts
were off. Higher levels of inattention in turn predicted lower productivity and
psychological well-being. These findings highlight some of the costs of
ubiquitous connectivity and suggest how people can reduce these costs simply by
adjusting existing phone settings.

%X Notifications are extremely beneficial to users, but they often demand their
attention at inappropriate moments. In this paper we present an in-situ study
of mobile interruptibility focusing on the effect of cognitive and physical
factors on the response time and the disruption perceived from a notification.
Through a mixed method of automated smartphone logging and experience sampling
we collected 10372 in-the-wild notifications and 474 questionnaire responses on
notification perception from 20 users. We found that the response time and the
perceived disruption from a notification can be influenced by its presentation,
alert type, sender-recipient relationship as well as the type, completion level
and complexity of the task in which the user is engaged. We found that even a
notification that contains important or useful content can cause disruption.
Finally, we observe the substantial role of the psychological traits of the
individuals on the response time and the disruption perceived from a
notification.

with curators, we co-created an interactive multi-narrative soundscape for the
remains of trenches and a fortified camp from World War I. The soundscape is
activated by presence and the use of a bespoke device. The design intertwines
technology and historical content in context to augment the visitors'
experience of the place in an evocative, personal way. The field trial showed
that experimenting with different forms is key, as they have an impact on
visitors' expectations beyond what they experience directly. It also showed the
value in simultaneously designing interaction and content to achieve an effect
that goes beyond the contribution of the single components.

%X Voice communication adds nuance and expressivity to virtual discussions, but
its one-shot nature tends to discourage collaborators from utilizing it.
However, text-based interfaces have made voice editing much easier, especially
with recent advancements enabling live, time-aligned speech transcription. We
introduce SimpleSpeech, an easy-to-use platform for asynchronous audio
communication (AAC) with lightweight tools for inserting content, adjusting
pauses, and correcting transcript errors. Qualitative and quantitative results
suggest that novice audio producers, such as high school students, experience
decreased mental workload when using SimpleSpeech to produce audio messages
than without editing. The linguistic formality in SimpleSpeech messages was
also studied, and found to form a middle ground between oral and written media.
Our findings on editable voice messages show new implications for the optimal
design and use cases of AAC systems.

measures and often ignored user experience and engagement. We present an
examination of crossmodal congruence in terms of performance and engagement in
the context of a memory task of audio, visual, and audio-visual stimuli.
Participants in a first study showed improved performance when using a visual
congruent mapping that was cancelled by the addition of audio to the baseline
conditions, and a subjective preference for the audio-visual stimulus that was
not reflected in the objective data. Based on these findings, we designed an
audio-visual memory game to examine the effects of crossmodal congruence on
user experience and engagement. Results showed higher engagement levels with
congruent displays with some reported preference for potential challenge and
enjoyment that an incongruent display may support, particularly for increased
task complexity.

%X Traditional audio guides in museums and similar spaces typically require the
visitor to locate a track number at each exhibit and enter it on a keypad.
These guides, however, provide no information on the amount of content
available. Current mobile devices provide rich output capabilities, and indoor
location tracking technology can simplify the selection of content in modern
audio guides. In this paper, we compare the keypad-based interface to a
map-based interface with and without automatic localization. Through a field
study in a local museum with 84 participants, we found that the usability of
all versions is rated high, with the keypad interface coming out ahead.
Nevertheless, visitors favored the overview of the map and thumbnails to find
the right exhibit, while numbers were considered helpful indicators in the real
world. Those who used the self-localizing guide preferred it over manually
adjusting the map.

shown to increase the risk of repeated lapses and, ultimately, program

management -- supporting users through lapses as part of a behavior-change
tool. We first review lessons from domains such as dieting and addiction
research and discuss the design space of lapse management. We then explore the
value of one approach to lapse management -- the use of "cheat points" -- as a
way to encourage sustained participation. In an online study, we first examine
interpretations of progress that was reached through using cheat points. We
then present findings from a deployment of lapse management in a two-week field
study with 30 participants. Our results demonstrate the potential of this
approach to motivate and change users' behavior. We discuss important open
questions for the design of future technology-mediated behavior change
programs.

%X Despite the prevalence of theories and interventions related to behavior
change, our knowledge on how intention for a target, or planned behavior,
changes over time remains limited. This hinders our ability to consider the
temporal aspect in our designs to support behavior change. To understand the
effect of temporal distances on planned behaviors, we conducted two studies,
building on the Theory of Planned Behavior and Constual Level Theory. We found
that attitude about the target is more salient the further away the event, as
people focus on the why of a behavior. On the other hand, perceived behavior
control can influence intention in both near and far future. When the target is
in the near future, people generally focus on the feasibility, or the how of
the behavior. In the far future, people may also consider factors related to
behavior control, if they are motivated to do so (i.e., hold a strong attitude
towards the action). Findings help advance the Theory of Planned Behavior and
offer strategies for designers and event organizers to motivate planned
behaviors that are in the near and far future.

receive real-time performance feedback. Although rock climbing is a trending
sport, there are little to no consumer electronics available to support rock
climbing training during exercise. In this paper, we investigated the
acceptance and appropriateness of wearables in climbing on different body
parts. Based on an online survey with 54 climbers, we designed a wearable
device and conducted a perception study with 12 participants in a climbing gym.
Using vibro-tactile, audible, and visual cues while climbing an easy route and
a hard route, requiring high physical and cognitive load, we found that the
most suited notification channel is sound, directly followed by vibro-tactile
output. Light has been found to be inappropriate for the use in the sport of
climbing.

exploration of why people abandon financial and location tracking tools, and we

and five perspectives on life after tracking. We discuss these results and

%X In human-computer interaction research and practice, policy concerns can
sometimes fall to the margins, orbiting at the periphery of the traditionally
core interests of design and practice. This perspective ignores the important
ways that policy is bound up with the technical and behavioral elements of the
HCI universe. Policy concerns are triggered as a matter of course in social
computing, CSCW, systems engineering, UX, and related contexts because
technological design, social practice and policy are dynamically entangled and
mutually constitutive. Through this research, we demonstrate the value of a
stronger emphasis on policy in HCI by exploring a recent controversy on Reddit:
"AMAgeddon." Applying Hirschman's exit, voice and loyalty framework, we argue
that the sustainability of online communities like Reddit will require
successful navigation of the complex and often murky intersections among
technical design and human interaction through a distributed participatory
policymaking process that promotes user loyalty.

investigate this by analyzing a protest against the social news platform reddit
by moderators of 2,278 subreddit communities in July 2015. These moderators

accessing major parts of reddit and convincing the company to negotiate over
their demands. This paper offers a descriptive analysis of the protest,
combining qualitative content analysis, interviews, and quantitative analysis
with the population of 52,735 active subreddits. Through participatory
hypotheses testing with moderators, this study reveals social factors including
the grievances of moderators, relations with platform operators, relations
among moderators, subreddit resources, subreddit isolation, and moderators'
relations with their subreddits that can lead to participation in mass
collective action against a platform.

facilitated community moderation, and (3) technological systems that mitigated
norm violations. We also point to several important trade-offs and limitations.

against community guidelines or is perceived to be deviant behavior. Users also
delete their own content that they feel is not appropriate within personal or
community norms. In this paper, we examine characteristics of over 30,000
pro-eating disorder (pro-ED) posts that were at one point public on Instagram
but have since been removed. Our work shows that straightforward signals can be
found in deleted content that distinguish them from other posts, and that the
implications of such classification are immense. We build a classifier that
compares public pro-ED posts with this removed content that achieves moderate
accuracy of 69%. We also analyze the characteristics in content in each of
these post categories and find that removed content reflects more dangerous
actions, self-harm tendencies, and vulnerability than posts that remain public.
Our work provides early insights into content removal in a sensitive community
and addresses the future research implications of the findings.

physical guitar and proxy artefacts. We contribute a conceptual framework for
accountable artefacts that articulates how multiple and complex mappings
between physical artefacts and their digital records may be created,
appropriated, shared and interrogated to deliver accounts of provenance and use
as well as methodological reflections on technology probes.

%X Sharing is an important facet of human relationships, yet there is a lack of
research on how people share ownership of possessions. This paper reports on a
study that investigates shared ownership of physical and digital possessions
through interviews with couples and families in 13 households. We offer a more
nuanced definition of shared ownership and show that certain practices, which
are central to sharing physical objects, are not supported in the sharing of
digital content. We suggest potential approaches to address this, focusing in
particular on how the sharing of possessions plays a role in the building of
relationships and is done against a backdrop of trust.

%X People accumulate huge assortments of virtual possessions, but it is not yet
clear how systems and system designers can help people make meaning from these
large archives. Early research in HCI has suggested that people generally
appear to value their virtual things less than their material things, but
theory on material possessions does not entirely explain this difference. To
investigate if changes to the form and behavior of virtual things may surface
valued elements of a virtual archive, we designed a technology probe that
selected snippets from old emails and mailed them as physical postcards to
participating households. The probe uncovered features of emails that trigger
meaningful reflection, and how contextual information can help people engage in
reminiscence. Our study revealed insights about how materializing virtual
possessions influences factors shaping how people draw on, understand, and
value those possessions. We conclude with implication and strategies for aimed
at supporting people in having more meaningful interactions and experiences
with their virtual possessions.

%X Email is far from dead; in fact the volume of messages exchanged daily, the
number of accounts per user, and the number of devices on which email is
accessed have been constantly growing. Most previous studies on email have
focused on management and retrieval behaviour within a single account and on a
single device. In this paper, we examine how people find email in today's
ecosystem through an in-depth qualitative diary study with 16 participants. We
found that personal and work accounts are managed differently, resulting in
diverse retrieval strategies: while work accounts are more structured and thus
email is retrieved through folders, personal accounts have fewer folders and
users rely primarily on the built-in search option. Moreover, retrieval occurs
primarily on laptops and PCs compared to smartphones. We explore the reasons,
and uncover barriers and workarounds related to managing multiple accounts and
devices. Finally, we consider new design possibilities for email clients to
better support how email is used today.

%X Emerging virtual reality (VR) displays must overcome the prevalent issue of
visual discomfort to provide high-quality and immersive user experiences. In
particular, the mismatch between vergence and accommodation cues inherent to
most stereoscopic displays has been a long standing challenge. In this paper,
we evaluate several adaptive display modes afforded by focus-tunable optics or
actuated displays that have the promise to mitigate visual discomfort caused by
the vergence-accommodation conflict, and improve performance in VR
environments. We also explore monovision as an unconventional mode that allows
each eye of an observer to accommodate to a different distance. While this
technique is common practice in ophthalmology, we are the first to report its
effectiveness for VR applications with a custom built set up. We demonstrate
that monovision and other focus-tunable display modes can provide better user
experiences and improve user performance in terms of reaction times and
accuracy, particularly for nearby simulated distances in VR.

%X In this paper, we explore the concept of a sparse peripheral display, which
augments the field-of-view of a head-mounted display with a lightweight,
low-resolution, inexpensively produced array of LEDs surrounding the central
high-resolution display. We show that sparse peripheral displays expand the
available field-of-view up to 190&deg; horizontal, nearly filling the human
field-of-view. We prototyped two proof-of-concept implementations of sparse
peripheral displays: a virtual reality headset, dubbed SparseLightVR, and an
augmented reality headset, called SparseLightAR. Using SparseLightVR, we
conducted a user study to evaluate the utility of our implementation, and a
second user study to assess different visualization schemes in the periphery
and their effect on simulator sickness. Our findings show that sparse
peripheral displays are useful in conveying peripheral information and
improving situational awareness, are generally preferred, and can help reduce
motion sickness in nausea-susceptible people.

%X Augmented Reality (AR) applications may require the precise alignment of
virtual objects to the real world. We propose automatic alignment of virtual
objects to physical constraints calculated from the real world in real time
("snapping to reality"). We demonstrate SnapToReality alignment techniques that
allow users to position, rotate, and scale virtual content to dynamic, real
world scenes. Our proof-of-concept prototype extracts 3D edge and planar
surface constraints. We furthermore discuss the unique design challenges of
snapping in AR, including the user's limited field of view, noise in constraint
extraction, issues with changing the view in AR, visualizing constraints, and
more. We also report the results of a user study evaluating SnapToReality,
confirming that aligning objects to the real world is significantly faster when
assisted by snapping to dynamically extracted constraints. Perhaps more
importantly, we also found that snapping in AR enables a fresh and expressive
form of AR content creation.

%X In collaborative activities, collaborators can use physical objects in their
shared environment as spatial cues to guide each other's attention.
Collaborative mixed reality environments (MREs) include both, physical and
digital objects. To study how virtual objects influence collaboration and
whether they are used as spatial cues, we conducted a controlled lab experiment
with 16 dyads. Results of our study show that collaborators favored the digital
objects as spatial cues over the physical environment and the physical objects:
Collaborators used significantly less deictic gestures in favor of more
disambiguous verbal references and a decreased subjective workload when virtual
objects were present. This suggests adding additional virtual objects as
spatial cues to MREs to improve user experience during collaborative mixed
reality tasks.

%X Low-cost smartphone adapters can bring virtual reality to the masses, but
input is typically limited to using head tracking, which makes it difficult to
perform complex tasks like navigation. Walking-in-place (WIP) offers a natural
and immersive form of virtual locomotion that can reduce simulation sickness.
WIP, however, is difficult to implement in mobile contexts as it typically
relies on bulky controllers or an external camera. We present VR-STEP; a WIP
implementation that uses real-time pedometry to implement virtual locomotion.
VR-STEP requires no additional instrumentation outside of a smartphone's
inertial sensors. A user study with 18 users compares VR-STEP with a commonly
used auto-walk navigation method and finds no significant difference in
performance or reliability, though VR-STEP was found to be more immersive and
intuitive.

%X Traditional face-to-face social interactions can be challenging for
individuals with autism, leading some to perceive and categorize them as less
social than their typically-developing peers. Individuals with autism may even
see themselves as less social relative to their peers. Online communities can
provide an alternative venue for social expression, enabling different types of
communication beyond face-to-face, oral interaction. Using ethnographic
methods, we studied the communication ecology that has emerged around a
Minecraft server for children with autism and their allies. Our analysis shows
how members of this community search for, practice, and define sociality
through a variety of communication channels. These findings suggest an
expansion in how sociality has traditionally been conceptualized for
individuals with autism.

%X For many people living with conditions such as autism, anxiety manifests so
powerfully it has a big impact on quality of life. By investigating the
suitability of truly customizable wearable health devices we build on prior
research that found each experience of anxiety in people with autism is unique,
so 'one-suits all' solutions are not suitable. In addition, users desire agency
and control in all aspects of the system. The participative approach we take is
to iteratively co-develop prototypes with end users. Here we describe a case
study of the co-development of one prototype, a digital stretch wristband that
records interaction for later reflection called Snap. Snap has been designed to
sit within a platform that allows the distributed and sustainable design,
manufacture and data analysis of customizable digital health technologies. We
contribute to HCI with (1) lessons learned from a DIY co-development process
that follows the principles of modularity, participation and iteration and (2)
the potential impact of technology in self-management of anxiety and the
broader design implications of addressing unique anxiety experiences.

facilitating human-human physical touch. In particular, we aim to support
children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), who often exhibit particular
communication patterns, such as lack of physical touch. EnhancedTouch is a
unique device that can measure human-human touch events and provide visual
feedback to augment touch interaction. We employ personal area network (PAN)
technology for communication with partner devices via modulated electrical
current flowing through the users' hands. Our user study show that the visual
feedback provided by the developed bracelet motivates children with ASD to
touch one another. Moreover, EnhancedTouch offers a function to record the time
and duration of a touch event as well as the identity of the touched person.
This allows us to identify and evaluate intervention based on physical touch in
a quantitative manner.

individual behaviours to supporting transitions at a societal level. In this
paper, we take a practice approach to the case of sustainable transportation,
and more specifically to car-free transportation. Car use is intertwined in
many practices and managing life without a car is difficult, particularly for
people in contexts where owning at least one car per family is the norm. We
studied three families in Stockholm who replaced their cars with different
combinations of light electric vehicles during one year. From the families'
experiences, we identified a number of opportunities for designers of
interactive technologies to support environmental pioneers in the particular
case of car-free living, as well as to support transitions towards sustainable
practices in general.

(5) Shift roles as needed throughout the design process. While a superficial
treatment of these differences might seem to disenfranchise green designers, we
show that an analysis of green design as a discursive practice highlights how,
through engagement with others, green design can enhance pro-environmental

%X Interactive devices and the services they support are reliant on the cloud
and the digital infrastructure supporting it. The environmental impacts of this
infrastructure are substantial and for particular services the infrastructure
can account for up to 85% of the total impact. In this paper, we apply the
principles of Sustainable Interaction Design to cloud services use of the
digital infrastructure. We perform a critical analysis of current design
practice with regard to interactive services, which we identify as the
cornucopian paradigm. We show how user-centered design principles induce
environmental impacts in different ways, and combine with technical and
business drivers to drive growth of the infrastructure through a reinforcing
feedback cycle. We then create a design rubric, substantially extending that of
Blevis [6], to cover impacts of the digital infrastructure. In doing so, we
engage in design criticism, identifying examples (both actual and potential) of
good and bad practice. We then extend this rubric beyond an eco-efficiency
paradigm to consider deeper and more radical perspectives on sustainability,
and finish with future directions for exploration.

improving accessibility, flexibility, portability, and accuracy. We describe

%X Users' individual differences in their mobile touch behaviour can help to
continuously verify identity and protect personal data. However, little is
known about the influence of GUI elements and hand postures on such touch
biometrics. Thus, we present a metric to measure the amount of user-revealing
information that can be extracted from touch targeting interactions and apply
it in eight targeting tasks with over 150,000 touches from 24 users in two
sessions. We compare touch-to-target offset patterns for four target types and
two hand postures. Our analyses reveal that small, compactly shaped targets
near screen edges yield the most descriptive touch targeting patterns.
Moreover, our results show that thumb touches are more individual than index
finger ones. We conclude that touch-based user identification systems should
analyse GUI layouts and infer hand postures. We also describe a framework to
estimate the usefulness of GUIs for touch biometrics.

increasing concern with these devices. We iteratively designed a tablet
interface that detects when people nearby are looking at the screen, providing
awareness through glyph notifications, and response through visual protections,
and evaluated its use in two experiments. The results indicate that mobile
content privacy management systems such as ours could help alleviate the
cognitive and social burden of managing mobile device privacy in dynamic
settings. We identify physical privacy behaviours and preferences that can
inform the design of privacy notification and management protocols on mobile
devices. We argue that such systems require subtlety so as not to advertise the
users' intention for privacy, flexibility in addressing dynamic privacy needs
and trustworthiness to promote adoption.

%X Secure user identification is important for the increasing number of eyewear
computers but limited input capabilities pose significant usability challenges
for established knowledge-based schemes, such as passwords or PINs. We present
SkullConduct, a biometric system that uses bone conduction of sound through the
user's skull as well as a microphone readily integrated into many of these
devices, such as Google Glass. At the core of SkullConduct is a method to
analyze the characteristic frequency response created by the user's skull using
a combination of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features as well as
a computationally light-weight 1NN classifier. We report on a controlled
experiment with 10 participants that shows that this frequency response is
person-specific and stable -- even when taking off and putting on the device
multiple times -- and thus serves as a robust biometric. We show that our
method can identify users with 97.0% accuracy and authenticate them with an
equal error rate of 6.9%, thereby bringing biometric user identification to
eyewear computers equipped with bone conduction technology.

can be frustrating, slow and error-prone. In this paper, we present an improved
pairing method that uses sets of English words instead of random strings. The
word method, although longer in terms of character length, allows users to pair
devices more quickly, whilst still maintaining the complexity necessary for
secure interactions.

%X HCI research has both endorsed "making" for its innovation and
democratization capacity and critiqued its underlying technosolutionism, i.e.,
the idea that technology provides solutions to complex social problems. This
paper offers a reflexive-interventionist approach that simultaneously takes
seriously the critiques of making's claims as technosolutionist while also
embracing its utopian project as worth reconstituting in broader sociopolitical
terms. It applies anthropological theory of the global and feminist-utopianism
to the analysis of findings from research on making cultures in Taiwan and
China. More specifically, the paper provides ethnographic snippets of utopian
glimmers in order to speculatively imagine and explore alternative futures of
making worth pursuing, and in so doing re-constitute the utopian vision of
making.

%X This paper examines the question of "values in repair" -- the distinct forms
of meaning and care that may be built into human-technology interactions
through individual and collective acts of repair. Our work draws on research in
HCI and the social sciences and findings from ethnographic studies in four
sites -- two amateur "fixers" collectives' in Brooklyn and Seattle, USA and two
mobile phone repair communities in Uganda and Bangladesh -- to advance two
arguments. First, studies of repair account for new sites and processes of
value that differ from those appearing at HCI's better-studied moments of
design and use. Second, repair may embed modes of human interaction with
technology and with each other in ways that surface values as contingent and
ongoing accomplishments, suggesting ongoing processes of valuation that can
never be fully fixed or commoditized. These insights help HCI account for human
relationships to technology built into the world through repair.

%X Makerspaces public workshops where makers can share tools and knowledge are
a growing resource for amateurs and professionals alike. While the role of
makerspaces in innovation and peer learning is widely discussed, we attempt to
look at the wider roles that makerspaces play in public life. Through site
visits and interviews at makerspaces and similar facilities across the UK, we
have identified additional roles that these spaces play: as social spaces, in
supporting wellbeing, by serving the needs of the communities they are located
in and by reaching out to excluded groups. Based on these findings, we suggest
implications and future directions for both makerspace organisers and community
researchers.

feminist hackerspaces in Northern California where we conducted fieldwork over
eighteen months in 2014 and 2015. Together we created and distributed a zine --
a self-published magazine produced with a photocopier -- that knit together
content of a published paper with local histories of feminist print production.
By tracing the efforts involved in this collaboration and its effects on our
research project, our research community, and ourselves, we extend HCI's
efforts to foster continued dialogue with our sites of study. We end by
outlining strategies for bolstering this mission both within and beyond HCI.

%X More people are learning to code than ever, but most learning opportunities
do not explicitly teach the problem solving skills necessary to succeed at
open-ended programming problems. In this paper, we present a new approach to
impart these skills, consisting of: 1) explicit instruction on programming
problem solving, which frames coding as a process of translating mental
representations of problems and solutions into source code, 2) a method of
visualizing and monitoring progression through six problem solving stages, 3)
explicit, on-demand prompts for learners to reflect on their strategies when
seeking help from instructors, and 4) context-sensitive help embedded in a code
editor that reinforces the problem solving instruction. We experimentally
evaluated the effects of our intervention across two 2-week web development
summer camps with 48 high school students, finding that the intervention
increased productivity, independence, programming self-efficacy, metacognitive
awareness, and growth mindset. We discuss the implications of these results on
learning technologies and classroom instruction.

%X Recent research suggests that some students learn to program with the goal
of becoming conversational programmers: they want to develop programming
literacy skills not to write code in the future but mainly to develop
conversational skills and communicate better with developers and to improve
their marketability. To investigate the existence of such a population of
conversational programmers in practice, we surveyed professionals at a large
multinational technology company who were not in software development roles.
Based on 3151 survey responses from professionals who never or rarely wrote
code, we found that a significant number of them (42.6%) had invested in
learning programming on the job. While many of these respondents wanted to
perform traditional end-user programming tasks (e.g., data analysis), we
discovered that two top motivations for learning programming were to improve
the efficacy of technical conversations and to acquire marketable skillsets.
The main contribution of this work is in empirically establishing the existence
and characteristics of conversational programmers in a large software
development context.

%X Much attention has focused on the lack of diversity in access and
participation in digital media available to youth. Far less attention has been
paid to the diversity of youth creators and the content that is produced by
youth. We examined the diversity of project creators, content, and comments in
one of the largest youth programming sites called Scratch (scratch.mit.edu),
with over 7 million registered members between ages 6-16, over 10 million
posted projects and 16 million comments. We used keyword and webcrawler
searches to reveal that only a small number of users (&lt;.01%) self-disclosed
their racial and ethnic identities. Case studies further illuminated how
project designs and comments delved into race, provided cultural critique or
addressed racial harassment. In the discussion, we address these blind spots of
diversity in massive online DIY youth communities, discuss methodological
limitations, and provide recommendations for future directions in supporting
diversity.

%X This paper contributes to a growing body of work that attempts to measure
informal learning online by revisiting two of the most surprising findings from
a 2012 study on skill progression in Scratch by Scaffidi and Chambers: users
tend to share decreasingly code-heavy projects over time; and users' projects
trend toward using a less diverse range of code concepts. We revisit Scaffidi
and Chambers's work in three ways: with a replication of their study using the
full population of projects from which they sampled, a simulation study that
replicates both their analytic and sampling methodology, and an alternative
analysis that addresses several important threats. Our results suggest that the
population estimates are opposite in sign to those presented in the original
work.

%X SkinTrack is a wearable system that enables continuous touch tracking on the
skin. It consists of a ring, which emits a continuous high frequency AC signal,
and a sensing wristband with multiple electrodes. Due to the phase delay
inherent in a high-frequency AC signal propagating through the body, a phase
difference can be observed between pairs of electrodes. SkinTrack measures
these phase differences to compute a 2D finger touch coordinate. Our approach
can segment touch events at 99% accuracy, and resolve the 2D location of
touches with a mean error of 7.6mm. As our approach is compact, non-invasive,
low-cost and low-powered, we envision the technology being integrated into
future smartwatches, supporting rich touch interactions beyond the confines of
the small touchscreen.

%X With the resurgence of head-mounted displays for virtual reality, users need
new input devices that can accurately track their hands and fingers in motion.
We introduce Finexus, a multipoint tracking system using magnetic field
sensing. By instrumenting the fingertips with electromagnets, the system can
track fine fingertip movements in real time using only four magnetic sensors.
To keep the system robust to noise, we operate each electromagnet at a
different frequency and leverage bandpass filters to distinguish signals
attributed to individual sensing points. We develop a novel algorithm to
efficiently calculate the 3D positions of multiple electromagnets from
corresponding field strengths. In our evaluation, we report an average accuracy
of 1.33 mm, as compared to results from an optical tracker. Our real-time
implementation shows Finexus is applicable to a wide variety of human input
tasks, such as writing in the air.

%X We present fingerIO, a novel fine-grained finger tracking solution for
around-device interaction. FingerIO does not require instrumenting the finger
with sensors and works even in the presence of occlusions between the finger
and the device. We achieve this by transforming the device into an active sonar
system that transmits inaudible sound signals and tracks the echoes of the
finger at its microphones. To achieve sub-centimeter level tracking accuracies,
we present an innovative approach that use a modulation technique commonly used
in wireless communication called Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
(OFDM). Our evaluation shows that fingerIO can achieve 2-D finger tracking with
an average accuracy of 8 mm using the in-built microphones and speaker of a
Samsung Galaxy S4. It also tracks subtle finger motion around the device, even
when the phone is in the pocket. Finally, we prototype a smart watch
form-factor fingerIO device and show that it can extend the interaction space
to a 0.5&times;0.25 m2 region on either side of the device and work even when
it is fully occluded from the finger.

%X Thumb-to-fingers interfaces augment touch widgets on fingers, which are
manipulated by the thumb. Such interfaces are ideal for one-handed eyes-free
input since touch widgets on the fingers enable easy access by the stylus
thumb. This study presents DigitSpace, a thumb-to-fingers interface that
addresses two ergonomic factors: hand anatomy and touch precision. Hand anatomy
restricts possible movements of a thumb, which further influences the physical
comfort during the interactions. Touch precision is a human factor that
determines how precisely users can manipulate touch widgets set on fingers,
which determines effective layouts of the widgets. Buttons and touchpads were
considered in our studies to enable discrete and continuous input in an
eyes-free manner. The first study explores the regions of fingers where the
interactions can be comfortably performed. According to the comfort regions,
the second and third studies explore effective layouts for button and touchpad
widgets. The experimental results indicate that participants could discriminate
at least 16 buttons on their fingers. For touchpad, participants were asked to
perform unistrokes. Our results revealed that since individual participant
performed a coherent writing behavior, personalized $1 recognizers could offer
92% accuracy on a cross-finger touchpad. A series of design guidelines are
proposed for designers, and a DigitSpace prototype that uses magnetic-tracking
methods is demonstrated.

%X The Head Mounted Projection Display (HMPD) is a growing interest area in
HCI. Although various aspects of HMPDs have been investigated, there is not
enough information regarding the effect of HMPDs (i.e., head referenced static
and dynamic displays while a user is in motion and standing) on visual
attentional performance. For this purpose, we conducted a user study (N=18)
with three experimental conditions (control, standing, walking) and two visual
perceptual tasks (with dynamic and static displays). Significant differences
between conditions were only found for the task with dynamic display; accuracy
was lower in walking condition compared to the other two conditions. Our work
contributes an empirical investigation of the effect of HMPDs on visual
attentional performance by providing data-driven benchmarks for developing
graphical user interface design guidelines for HMPDs.

%X Recent mobile technology has provided new opportunities for creating remote
assistance systems. However, mobile support systems present a particular
challenge: both the camera and display are held by the user, leading to shaky
video. When pointing or drawing annotations, this means that the desired target
often moves, causing the gesture to lose its intended meaning. To address this
problem, we investigate annotation stabilization techniques, which allow
annotations to stick to their intended location. We studied two annotation
systems, using three different forms of annotations, with both tablets and
head-mounted displays. Our analysis suggests that stabilized annotations and
head-mounted displays are only beneficial in certain situations. However, the
simplest approach of automatically freezing video while drawing annotations was
surprisingly effective in facilitating the completion of remote assistance
tasks.

%X Our research explores how humans can understand and develop viewing
behaviors with mutual paralleled first person view sharing in which a person
can see others' first person video perspectives as well as their own
perspective in realtime. We developed a paralleled first person view sharing
system which consists of multiple video see-through head mounted displays and
an embedded eye tracking system. With this system, four persons can see four
shared first person videos of each other. We then conducted workshop based
research with two activities, drawing pictures and playing a simple chasing
game with our view sharing system. Our results show that 1) people can
complement each other's memory and decisions and 2) people can develop their
viewing behaviors to understand their own physical embodiment and spatial
relationship with others in complex situations. Our findings about patterns of
viewing behavior and design implications will contribute to building design
experience in paralleled view sharing applications.

%X Video communication using head-mounted cameras could be useful to mediate
shared activities and support collaboration. Growing popularity of wearable
gaze trackers presents an opportunity to add gaze information on the egocentric
video. We hypothesized three potential benefits of gaze-augmented egocentric
video to support collaborative scenarios: support deictic referencing, enable
grounding in communication, and enable better awareness of the collaborator's
intentions. Previous research on using egocentric videos for real-world
collaborative tasks has failed to show clear benefits of gaze point
visualization. We designed a study, deconstructing a collaborative car
navigation scenario, to specifically target the value of gaze-augmented video
for intention prediction. Our results show that viewers of gaze-augmented video
could predict the direction taken by a driver at a four-way intersection more
accurately and more confidently than a viewer of the same video without the
superimposed gaze point. Our study demonstrates that gaze augmentation can be
useful and encourages further study in real-world collaborative scenarios.

%X Internet of things (IoT) devices and sensor kits have the potential to
democratize the access, use, and appropriation of data. Despite the increased
availability of low cost sensors, most of the produced data is "black box" in
nature: users often do not know how to access or interpret data. We propose a
"human-data design" approach in which end-users are given tools to create,
share, and use data through tangible and physical visualizations. This paper
introduces Physikit, a system designed to allow users to explore and engage
with environmental data through physical ambient visualizations. We report on
the design and implementation of Physikit, and present a two-week field study
which showed that participants got an increased sense of the meaning of data,
embellished and appropriated the basic visualizations to make them blend into
their homes, and used the visualizations as a probe for community engagement
and social behavior.

%X Increasingly, governments and organisations publish data on expenditure and
finance as 'open' data in order to be more transparent to the public in how
funding is spent. Accountable is a web-based tool that visualises and relates
open financial data provided by local government and non-profit organisations
(NPOs) in the UK. A qualitative study was conducted where Accountable was
treated as a technology probe, and used by representatives of NPOs and members
of the public who invest their time or effort voluntarily into such
organisations. The study highlighted how: current open data sets provided by
public bodies are inadequate in their representation of funding structures; the
focus on finance and fiscal expenditure in such data makes invisible the
in-kind effort of volunteers and the wider beneficiaries of an organisation's
work; and problems arising from the interoperability of open data technologies.
The paper concludes with implications for the design of future systems,
considering the domains of transparency and accountability in relation to the
findings.

such as Uber and Lyft-have affected the livelihood of thousands of workers
worldwide. In this paper we draw on interviews with traditional taxi drivers,
rideshare drivers and passengers in London and San Francisco to understand how
"ride-sharing" transforms the taxi business. With Uber, the app not only
manages the allocation of work, but is directly involved in "labour issues":
changing the labour conditions of the work itself. We document how Uber driving
demands new skills such as emotional labour, while increasing worker
flexibility. We discuss how the design of new technology is also about creating

%X Timebanking is a growing type of peer-to-peer service exchange, but is
hampered by the effort of finding good transaction partners. We seek to reduce
this effort by using a Matching Algorithm for Service Transactions (MAST). MAST
matches transaction partners in terms of similarity of interests and
complementarity of abilities and needs. We present an experiment involving data
and participants from a real timebanking network, that evaluates the
acceptability of MAST, and shows that such an algorithm can retrieve matches
that are subjectively better than matches based on matching the category of
people's historical offers or requests to the category of a current transaction
request.

%X Digital currencies represent a new method for exchange -- a payment method
with no physical form, made real by the Internet. This new type of currency was
created to ease online transactions and to provide greater convenience in
making payments. However, a critical component of a monetary system is the
people who use it. Acknowledging this, we present results of our interview
study (N=20) with two groups of participants (users and non-users) about how
they perceive the most popular digital currency, Bitcoin. Our results reveal:
non-users mistakenly believe they are incapable of using Bitcoin, users are not
well-versed in how the protocol functions, they have misconceptions about the
privacy of transactions, and that Bitcoin satisfies properties of ideal payment
systems as defined by our participants. Our results illustrate Bitcoin's
tradeoffs, its uses, and barriers to entry.

%X We examine how financial assurance structures and the clearly defined
financial transaction at the core of monetized network hospitality reduce
uncertainty for Airbnb hosts and guests. We apply the principles of social
exchange and intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to a qualitative study of
Airbnb hosts to 1) describe activities that are facilitated by the peer-to-peer
exchange platform and 2) how the assurance of the initial financial exchange
facilitates additional social exchanges between hosts and guests. The study
illustrates that the financial benefits of hosting do not necessarily crowd out
intrinsic motivations for hosting but instead strengthen them and even act as a
gateway to further social exchange and interpersonal interaction. We describe
the assurance structures in networked peer-to-peer exchange, and explain how
such assurances can reconcile contention between extrinsic and intrinsic
motivations. We conclude with implications for design and future research.

%X Using game balancing techniques can provide the right level of challenge and
hence enhance player engagement for sport players with different skill levels.
Digital technology can support and enhance balancing techniques in sports, for
example, by adjusting players' level of intensity based on their heart rate.
However, there is limited knowledge on how to design such balancing and its
impact on the user experience. To address this we created two novel balancing
techniques enabled by digitally augmenting a table tennis table. We adjusted
the more skilled player's performance by inducing two different styles of play
and studied the effects on game balancing and player engagement. We showed that
by altering the more skilled player's performance we can balance the game
through: (i) encouraging game mistakes, and (ii) changing the style of play to
one that is easier for the opponent to counteract. We outline the advantages
and disadvantages of each approach, extending our understanding of game
balancing design. We also show that digitally augmenting sports offers
opportunities for novel balancing techniques while facilitating engaging
experiences, guiding those interested in HCI and sports.

%X We explore design opportunities for using interactive technologies to enrich
group fitness exercises, such as group spinning and swimming, in which an
instructor guides a workout program and members synchronously perform a shared
physical activity. As a case study, we investigate group fitness swimming. The
design challenge is to coordinate a large group of people by considering
trade-offs between social awareness and information overload. Our resulting
group fitness swimming game, SwimTrain, allows a group of people to have
localized synchronous interactions over a virtual space. The game uses
competitive and cooperative phases to help group members acquire group-wide
awareness. The results of our user study showed that SwimTrain provides
socially-enriched swimming experiences, motivates swimmers to follow a training
regimen and exert more intensely, and allows strategic game play dealing with
skill differences among swimmers. Consequently, we propose several practical
considerations for designing group fitness exergames.

%X It has been argued that transparent displays are beneficial for certain
tasks by allowing users to simultaneously see on-screen content as well as the
environment behind the display. However, it is yet unclear how much in
background awareness users gain and if performance suffers for tasks performed
on the transparent display, since users are no longer shielded from
distractions. Therefore, we investigate the influence of display transparency
on task performance and background awareness in a dual-task scenario. We
conducted an experiment comparing transparent displays with conventional
displays in different horizontal and vertical configurations. Participants
performed an attention-demanding primary task on the display while
simultaneously observing the background for target stimuli. Our results show
that transparent and horizontal displays increase the ability of participants
to observe the background while keeping primary task performance constant.

%X While email provides numerous benefits in the workplace, it is unclear how
patterns of email use might affect key workplace indicators of productivity and
stress. We investigate how three email use patterns: duration, interruption
habit, and batching, relate to perceived workplace productivity and stress. We
tracked email usage with computer logging, biosensors and daily surveys for 40
information workers in their in situ workplace environments for 12 workdays. We
found that the longer daily time spent on email, the lower was perceived
productivity and the higher the measured stress. People who primarily check
email through self-interruptions report higher productivity with longer email
duration compared to those who rely on notifications. Batching email is
associated with higher rated productivity with longer email duration, but
despite widespread claims, we found no evidence that batching email leads to
lower stress. We discuss the implications of our results for improving
organizational email practices.

%X Maintaining work focus when on a computer is a major challenge, and people
often feel that they use their time ineffectively. To improve focus we designed
meTime, a real-time awareness application that shows users how they allocate
their time across applications. In two real-world deployments involving 118
participants, we examined whether greater awareness of time use improves focus.
In our first deployment, we provided awareness information using meTime, to
both office workers and students. Exposure to meTime reduced use of social
media, email, browsing and total time online. However increased awareness
didn't affect time spent in productivity applications. A second educational
deployment largely replicated these results and showed that meTime also reduced
users' perceptions of their ability to focus effectively. Changed perceptions
were associated with higher class grades. We discuss practical and theoretical
implications as well as design principles for use of time applications.

%X In HCI research, attention has focused on understanding external influences
on workplace multitasking. We explore instead how multitasking might be
influenced by individual factors: personality, stress, and sleep. Forty
information workers' online activity was tracked over two work weeks. The
median duration of online screen focus was 40 seconds. The personality trait of
Neuroticism was associated with shorter online focus duration and
Impulsivity-Urgency was associated with longer online focus duration. Stress
and sleep duration showed trends to be inversely associated with online focus.
Shorter focus duration was associated with lower assessed productivity at day's
end. Factor analysis revealed a factor of lack of control which significantly
predicts multitasking. Our results suggest that there could be a trait for
distractibility where some individuals are susceptible to online attention
shifting in the workplace. Our results have implications for information
systems (e.g. educational systems, game design) where attention focus is key.

%X This paper is about the aspects of ability, selfhood, and normalcy embodied
in people's relationships with prostheses. Drawing on interviews with 14
individuals with upper-limb loss and diverse experiences with prostheses, we
find people not only choose to use and not use prosthesis throughout their
lives but also form close and complex relationships with them. The design of
"assistive" technology often focuses on enhancing function; however, we found
that prostheses played important roles in people's development of identity and
sense of normalcy. Even when a prosthesis failed functionally, such as was the
case with 3D-printed prostheses created by an on-line open-source maker
community (e-NABLE), we found people still praised the design and initiative
because of the positive impacts on popular culture, identity, and community
building. This work surfaces crucial questions about the role of design
interventions in identity production, the promise of maker communities for
accelerating innovation, and a broader definition of "assistive" technology.

emerging location-based technologies therein. We conducted a three-part
formative study with 20 mobility impaired participants: a semi-structured
interview (Part 1), a participatory design activity (Part 2), and a design
probe activity (Part 3). Part 2 and 3 actively engaged our participants in
exploring and designing the future of what we call assistive location-based

accessibility features to support navigating, searching, and exploring the
physical world. Our Part 1 findings highlight how existing mapping tools
provide accessibility benefits even though often not explicitly designed for
such uses. Findings in Part 2 and 3 help identify and uncover useful features
of future ALTs. In particular, we synthesize 10 key features and 6 key data
qualities. We conclude with ALT design recommendations.

amputations working with researchers to design prosthetic devices for specific
tasks: playing the cello, operating a hand-cycle, and using a table knife. Our
goal was to identify requirements for a design process that can engage the
assistive technology user in rapidly prototyping assistive devices that fill
needs not easily met by traditional assistive technology. Our study made use of
3D printing and other playful and practical prototyping materials. We discuss
materials that support on-the-spot design and iteration, dimensions along which
in-person iteration is most important (such as length and angle) and the value
of a supportive social network for users who prototype their own assistive
technology. From these findings we argue for the importance of extensions in
supporting modularity, community engagement, and relatable prototyping
materials in the iterative design of prosthetics.

rehabilitation in the home, focusing on seated forward reach movements of the
upper limb. Participants (n=3), all at least 11 months post stroke,
participated in 15 researcher-led music making sessions over a 5 week
intervention period. The sessions involved them 'drumming' to the beat of
self-chosen tunes using bespoke digital drum pads that were synced wirelessly
to an iPad App and triggered percussion sounds as feedback. They were
encouraged to continue these exercises when the researcher was not present. The
results showed significant levels of self-management and significant increases
in functional measures with some evidence for transfer into tasks of daily
living.

report on the types of devices people are inserting into their bodies. We
classify the use of insertables and the reasons individuals choose insertables
over more traditional wearable or luggable devices. These classifications
facilitate understanding of insertables as a legitimate category of device for
hardware designers that present new challenges for interaction designers.

%X Women's understandings of their own intimate anatomy has been identified as
critical to women's reproductive health and sexual wellbeing. However, talking
about it, seeking medical help when necessary as well as examining oneself in
order to 'know' oneself is complicated by social-cultural constructions of the
vagina, i.e. it is something private, shameful and not to be talked about. In
response to this, we designed Labella, an augmented system that supports
intimate bodily knowledge and pelvic fitness in women. It combines a pair of
underwear and a mobile phone as a tool for embodied intimate self-discovery. In
this paper, we describe Labella, and its evaluation with fourteen women, aged
25-63. We show how through situated embodied perception Labella empowers
'looking'. We highlight how the simple act of augmented looking enables the
construction of knowledge which ranges from establishing the 'very basics'
through to a nuanced understanding of pelvic muscle structure. Finally, we
highlight the role of awkwardness and humour in the design of interactions to
overcome taboo.

limited forms suggested by the former approach. Our analysis highlights the
implications of limited participation and demonstrates how the CHI community is
uniquely positioned to ameliorate these limitations.

on the number and quality of contributions? We present a controlled study
comparing the effects of mandatory registration with an interface that enables
people to participate without registering, but allows them to sign up to
'claim' contributions. We demonstrate that removing the requirement to register
increases the number of visitors to the site contributing to the project by
62%, without reducing data quality. We also discover that contribution rates
are the same for people who choose to register, and those who remain anonymous,
indicating that the interface should cater for differences in participant
motivation. The study provides evidence that to maximize contribution rates,
projects should offer the option to create an account, but the process should
not be a barrier to immediate contribution, nor should it be required.

technology. Our findings are child-centred, focusing on three different roles
that tablets can play as part of learning activities: Friend, Functionary, and

critical discussions around the integration and impact of these devices in the
educational context, from a design and educational point of view.

which predicts the required time from the index of difficulty (ID). This paper
focuses on the fact that the time required to pass through a straight path with
linearly-varying width alters depending on the direction of the movement. In
this study, an expression for the relationship between the ID of narrowing and
widening paths has been developed. This expression can be used to predict the
movement time needed to pass through in the opposite direction from only a few
data points, after measuring the time needed in the other direction. In the
experiment, the times for five IDs were predicted with high precision from the
measured time for one ID, thereby illustrating the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

%X We present a novel model to predict error rates in temporal pointing. With
temporal pointing, a target is about to appear within a limited time window for
selection. Unlike in spatial pointing, there is no movement to control in the
temporal domain; the user can only determine when to launch the response.
Although this task is common in interactions requiring temporal precision,
rhythm, or synchrony, no previous HCI model predicts error rates as a function
of task properties. Our model assumes that users have an implicit point of aim
but their ability to elicit the input event at that time is hampered by
variability in three processes: 1) an internal time-keeping process, 2) a
response-execution stage, and 3) input processing in the computer. We derive a
mathematical model with two parameters from these assumptions. High fit is
shown for user performance with two task types, including a rapidly paced game.
The model can explain previous findings showing that touchscreens are much
worse in temporal pointing than physical input devices. It also has novel

%X Research claims that users value the battery life of their smartphones, but
no study to date has attempted to quantify battery value and how this value
changes according to users' current context and needs. Previous work has
quantified the monetary value that smartphone users place on their data (e.g.,
location), but not on battery life. Here we present a field study and
methodology for systematically measuring the monetary value of smartphone
battery life, using a reverse second-price sealed-bid auction protocol. Our
results show that the prices for the first and last 10% battery segments differ
substantially. Our findings also quantify the tradeoffs that users consider in
relation to battery, and provide a monetary model that can be used to measure
the value of apps and enable fair ad-hoc sharing of smartphone resources.

%X Mealtimes are a cherished part of everyday life around the world. Often
centered on family, friends, or special occasions, sharing meals is a practice
embedded with traditions and values. However, as mobile phone adoption becomes
increasingly pervasive, tensions emerge about how appropriate it is to use
personal devices while sharing a meal with others. Furthermore, while personal
devices have been designed to support awareness for the individual user (e.g.,
notifications), little is known about how to support shared awareness in
acceptability in social settings such as meals. In order to understand
attitudes about mobile phone use during shared mealtimes, we conducted an
online survey with 1,163 English-speaking participants. We find that attitudes
about mobile phone use at meals differ depending on the particular phone
activity and on who at the meal is engaged in that activity, children versus
adults. We also show that three major factors impact participants' attitudes:
1) their own mobile phone use; 2) their age; and 3) whether a child is present
at the meal. We discuss the potential for incorporating social awareness
features into mobile phone systems to ease tensions around conflicting mealtime
behaviors and attitudes.

%X The use of applications on mobile devices has changed dramatically over the
past few years. While web browsing was once a common activity, it's now
reported that 86% of time on mobile phones is in apps other than the browser.
We set out to understand how the mobile web was currently fitting into people's
lives and what web sessions looked like. Finding a dramatic reduction in mobile
web revisitation rates compared to previous work and that a large number of
sessions comprised single page views, we then studied how web content was
shared with others in mobile messaging, the source of many single page
sessions. The HCI community has not heavily studied this sharing activity that
many people perform daily. We conclude with design implications for new mobile
applications from our two studies with a combined 287 participants where we
studied actual logs of mobile web use and link sharing behavior.

%X Text messaging has long been a popular activity, and today smartphone apps
enable users to choose from a plethora of mobile messaging applications. While
we know a lot about SMS practices, we know less about practices of messaging
applications. In this paper, we take a first step to explore one ubiquitous
aspect of mobile messaging -- messaging history. We designed, built, and
trialled a mobile messaging application without history named forget-me-not.
The two-week trial showed that history-less messaging no longer supports
chit-chat as seen in e.g. WhatsApp, but is still considered conversational and
more 'engaging'. Participants expressed being lenient and relaxed about what
they wrote. Removing the history allowed us to gain insights into what uses
history has in other mobile messaging applications, such as planning events,
allowing for distractions, and maintaining multiple conversation threads.

%X We show that when users make errors on mobile devices they make immediate
and distinct physical responses that can be observed with standard sensors. We
used three standard cognitive tasks (Flanker, Stroop and SART) to induce errors
from 20 participants. Using simple low-resolution capacitive touch sensors
placed around a standard mobile device and the built-in accelerometer, we
demonstrate that errors can be predicted at low error rates from
micro-adjustments to hand grip and movement in the period shortly after swiping
the touchscreen. Specifically, when combining features derived from hand grip
and movement we obtain a mean AUC of 0.96 (with false accept and reject rates
both below 10%). Our results demonstrate that hand grip and movement provide
strong and low latency evidence for mistakes. The ability to detect user errors
in this way could be a valuable component in future interaction systems,
allowing interfaces to make it easier for users to correct erroneous inputs.

%X Most touchscreen devices are not designed specifically with children in
mind, and their interfaces often do not optimize interaction for children.
Prior work on children and touchscreen interaction has found important
patterns, but has only focused on simplified, isolated interactions, whereas
most interfaces are more visually complex. We examine how interface complexity
might impact children's touchscreen interactions. We collected touch and
gesture data from 30 adults and 30 children (ages 5 to 10) to look for
similarities, differences, and effects of interface complexity. Interface
complexity affected some touch interactions, primarily related to visual
salience, and it did not affect gesture recognition. We also report general
differences between children and adults. We provide design recommendations that
support the design of touchscreen interfaces specifically tailored towards
children of this age.

%X We present two contributions toward improving the accessibility of touch
screens for people with motor impairments. First, we provide an exploration of
the touch behaviors of 10 people with motor impairments, e.g., we describe how
touching with the back or sides of the hand, with multiple fingers, or with
knuckles creates varied multi-point touches. Second, we introduce Smart Touch,
a novel template-matching technique for touch input that maps any number of
arbitrary contact-areas to a user's intended (x,y) target location. The result
is that users with motor impairments can touch however their abilities allow,
and Smart Touch will resolve their intended touch point. Smart Touch therefore
allows users to touch targets in whichever ways are most comfortable and
natural for them. In an experimental evaluation, we found that Smart Touch
predicted (x,y) coordinates of the users' intended target locations over three
times closer to the intended target than the native Land-on and Lift-off
techniques reported by the built-in touch sensors found in the Microsoft
PixelSense interactive tabletop. This result is an important step toward
improving touch accuracy for people with motor impairments and others for whom
touch screen operation was previously impossible.

%X We present experimental work which explores the effect of touch indirectness
on spatial memory and navigation performance in a 2D panning task. In this
regard and based on the theory of embodied cognition, prior work has observed
performance increases for direct touch input over indirect mouse input. As
indirect touch systems gain in importance, we designed an experiment to
systematically investigate the effect of spatial indirectness while maintaining
the proprioceptive and kinesthetic cues provided by touch input. In an abstract
search task, participants of our study navigated a 2D space and were asked to
reproduce spatial item configurations in a recall task. Our results indicate
that spatial memory performance is not decreased by a spatial separation of
touch input gestures and visual display. Further, our results suggest that
decreasing the size of the input surface in the indirect condition increases
the navigation efficiency.

%X Text entry using gaze-based interaction is a vital communication tool for
people with motor impairments. Most solutions require the user to fixate on a
key for a given dwell time to select it, thus limiting the typing speed. In
this paper we introduce EyeSwipe, a dwell-time-free gaze-typing method. With
EyeSwipe, the user gaze-types the first and last characters of a word using the
novel selection mechanism "reverse crossing." To gaze-type the characters in
the middle of the word, the user only needs to glance at the vicinity of the
respective keys. We compared the performance of EyeSwipe with that of a
dwell-time-based virtual keyboard. EyeSwipe afforded statistically
significantly higher typing rates and more comfortable interaction in
experiments with ten participants who reached 11.7 words per minute (wpm) after
30 min typing with EyeSwipe.

on-demand generation of haptic experiences is lagging behind these advances in
other feedback channels. We present Annexing Reality; a system that
opportunistically annexes physical objects from a user's current physical
environment to provide the best-available haptic sensation for virtual objects.
It allows content creators to a priori specify haptic experiences that adapt to
the user's current setting. The system continuously scans user's surrounding,
selects physical objects that are similar to given virtual objects, and
overlays the virtual models on to selected physical ones reducing the
visual-haptic mismatch. We describe the developer's experience with the
Annexing Reality system and the techniques utilized in realizing it. We also
present results of a developer study that validates the usability and utility
of our method of defining haptic experiences.

%X Manipulating a virtual object with appropriate passive haptic cues provides
a satisfying sense of presence in virtual reality. However, scaling such
experiences to support multiple virtual objects is a challenge as each one
needs to be accompanied with a precisely-located haptic proxy object. We
propose a solution that overcomes this limitation by hacking human perception.
We have created a framework for repurposing passive haptics, called haptic
retargeting, that leverages the dominance of vision when our senses conflict.
With haptic retargeting, a single physical prop can provide passive haptics for
multiple virtual objects. We introduce three approaches for dynamically
aligning physical and virtual objects: world manipulation, body manipulation
and a hybrid technique which combines both world and body manipulation. Our
study results indicate that all our haptic retargeting techniques improve the
sense of presence when compared to typical wand-based 3D control of virtual
objects. Furthermore, our hybrid haptic retargeting achieved the highest
satisfaction and presence scores while limiting the visible side-effects during
interaction.

%X In this paper, we propose a novel interactive system that mutually copies
adjacent 3D environments optically and physically. The system realizes mutual
user interactions through haptics without wearing any devices. A realistic
volumetric image is displayed using a pair of micro-mirror array plates
(MMAPs). The MMAP transmissively reflects the rays from an object, and a pair
of them reconstructs the floating aerial image of the object. Our system can
optically copy adjacent environments based on this technology. Haptic feedback
is also given by using an airborne ultrasound tactile display (AUTD). Converged
ultrasound can give force feedback in midair. Based on the optical
characteristics of the MMAPs, the cloned image and the user share an identical
coordinate system. When a user touches the transferred clone image, the system
gives force feedback so that the user can feel the mechanical contact and
reality of the floating image.

In combination with a 3D graphics rendered environment, Dexmo provides the user

device is working reliably and that the addition of force feedback resulted in
a significant reduction in error rate. Informal comments by the participants

(VR) leads to simulator sickness, storytellers currently have no way of
controlling users' attention. SwiVRChair allows creators of 360 degree VR movie
content to be able to rotate or block users' movement to either show certain
content or prevent users from seeing something. To enable this functionality,
we modified a regular swivel chair using a 24V DC motor and an electromagnetic
clutch. We developed two demo scenarios using both mechanisms (rotate and
block) for the Samsung GearVR and conducted a user study (n=16) evaluating the
presence, enjoyment and simulator sickness for participants using SwiVRChair
compared to self control (Foot Control). Users rated the experience using
SwiVRChair to be significantly more immersive and enjoyable whilst having a
decrease in simulator sickness.

%X While motivational affordances are widely used to enhance user engagement in

guidance about how individuals with different dispositions may react-positively
and negatively-to specific affordances. In this paper, we present a survey
study investigating the relationships among individuals' personality traits and
perceived preferences for various motivational affordances used in
gamification. Our results show that extraverts tend to be motivated by Points,
Levels, and Leaderboards; people with high levels of imagination/openness are
less likely to be motivated by Avatars. Negative correlations were found
between emotional stability (the inverse of neuroticism) and several
motivational affordances, indicating a possible limitation of gamification as
an approach for a large segment of the population. Our findings contribute to
the HCI community, and in particular to designers of persuasive and gamified
apps, by providing design suggestions for targeting specific audiences based on
personality.

instruction in technical disciplines including the medical field. Assessments
of player performance are important in understanding user profiles in order to
establish serious games as a reliable, consistent method for increasing skills
and competence in all trainees. In this study we used questionnaires, game
characteristic metrics and EEG analysis to explore players' performance in a
bronchoscopy simulator. We found that players who performed better were
younger, made fewer errors, were quicker and differed in spectral profile
during game play. Our findings, while speculative, have implications for
training regimes in which gamified simulations are employed. We make
suggestions for game design and for tailoring training regimes to suit
individual learning styles to enhance knowledge acquisition and retention.

In a twelve-day-long study (N=20) we investigated the usefulness of a task

studies, we derived requirements "bottom-up" applications should fulfill. The
study results reveal that people want to use such an approach and are open to
the creation of their own gamified experience, thus suggesting that "bottom-up"
can be an alternative to "top-down" gamification often used today.

to help motivate patients who have had a BI engage in rehabilitation tasks. In
this paper, we present a prototype 'Choose a Game' tool that focuses on helping
therapists select appropriate games that match their therapeutic goals and
patient attributes. The tool leveraged a knowledge-base that we created about
COTS games use in BI therapy. We evaluated the prototype through user studies
with 29 therapists at two rehabilitation hospitals. While further improvements
are needed, the tool enabled therapists to use games from a wider range of
selections and therapists were generally satisfied with the game
recommendations and the tool's user experience. This project is also a
demonstration of a novel research model for investigating domains where
technologies are rapidly proliferating for users with wide-ranging attributes
such as the domain of therapeutic gaming for BI rehabilitation.

Results show differences in participants' awareness in collaborative tasks
between the two input methods. The results also help understand the physical
constraints touch input set on participants' control of actions in
collaborative tasks. We discuss how this influences collaboration. Results also
show that touch input did not promote more equal participation than mouse
input. We contrast the findings to earlier research on wall-display and

%X There is a steadily growing interest in the design of spaces in which
multiple interactive surfaces are present and, in turn, in understanding their
role in group activity. However, authentic activities in these multi-surface
spaces can be complex. Groups commonly use digital and non-digital artefacts,
tools and resources, in varied ways depending on their specific social and
epistemic goals. Thus, designing for collaboration in such spaces can be very
challenging. Importantly, there is still a lack of agreement on how to approach
the analysis of groups' experiences in these heterogeneous spaces. This paper
presents an actionable approach that aims to address the complexity of
understanding multi-user multi-surface systems. We provide a structure for
applying different analytical tools in terms of four closely related dimensions
of user activity: the setting, the tasks, the people and the runtime
co-configuration. The applicability of our approach is illustrated with six
types of analysis of group activity in a multi-surface design studio.

adopt a range of collaboration styles, from loosely to closely coupled. Shared
interaction techniques, in which multiple users perform a command
collaboratively, have also been introduced to support co-located collaborative
work. In this paper, we operationalize five collaborative situations with
increasing levels of coupling, and test the effects of providing shared
interaction support for a data manipulation task in each situation. The results
show the benefits of shared interaction for close collaboration: it encourages
collaborative manipulation, it is more efficient and preferred by users, and it
reduces physical navigation and fatigue. We also identify the time costs caused
by disruption and communication in loose collaboration and analyze the
trade-offs between parallelization and close collaboration. These findings
inform the design of shared interaction techniques to support collaboration on
wall-sized displays.

%X Taking notes has been shown helpful for learning. This activity, however, is
not well supported when learning from watching lecture videos. The conventional
video interface does not allow users to quickly locate and annotate important
content in the video as notes. Moreover, users sometimes need to manually pause
the video while taking notes, which is often distracting. In this paper, we
develop a gaze-based system to assist a user in notetaking while watching
lecture videos. Our system has two features to support notetaking. First, our
system integrates offline video analysis and online gaze analysis to
automatically detect and highlight key content from the lecture video for
notetaking. Second, our system provides adaptive video control that
automatically reduces the video playback speed or pauses it while a user is
taking notes to minimize the user's effort in controlling video. Our study
shows that our system enables users to take notes more easily and with better
quality than the traditional video interface.

%X History of mental illness is a major factor behind suicide risk and
ideation. However research efforts toward characterizing and forecasting this
risk is limited due to the paucity of information regarding suicide ideation,
exacerbated by the stigma of mental illness. This paper fills gaps in the
literature by developing a statistical methodology to infer which individuals
could undergo transitions from mental health discourse to suicidal ideation. We
utilize semi-anonymous support communities on Reddit as unobtrusive data
sources to infer the likelihood of these shifts. We develop language and
interactional measures for this purpose, as well as a propensity score matching
based statistical approach. Our approach allows us to derive distinct markers
of shifts to suicidal ideation. These markers can be modeled in a prediction
framework to identify individuals likely to engage in suicidal ideation in the
future. We discuss societal and ethical implications of this research.

%X Online communities can promote illness recovery and improve well-being in
the cases of many kinds of illnesses. However, for challenging mental health
condition like anorexia, social media harbor both recovery communities as well
as those that encourage dangerous behaviors. The effectiveness of such
platforms in promoting recovery despite housing both communities is
underexplored. Our work begins to fill this gap by developing a statistical
framework using survival analysis and situating our results within the
cognitive behavioral theory of anorexia. This model identifies content and
participation measures that predict the likelihood of recovery. From our
dataset of over 68M posts and 10K users that self-identify with anorexia, we
find that recovery on Tumblr is protracted -- only half of the population is
estimated to exhibit signs of recovery after four years. We discuss the
effectiveness of social media in improving well-being around anorexia, a unique
health challenge, and emergent questions from this line of work.

promote the mental health and wellbeing of a group of women, suffering from
significant mental health problems and living in a medium secure hospital unit.
First, we describe how our relationship with mental health professionals at the
hospital and the aspirations for person-centric care that we shared with them
enabled us, in the design of the Spheres, to innovate outside traditional
healthcare procedures. We then provide insights into the challenges presented
by the particular care culture and existing services and practices in the
secure hospital unit that were revealed through our technology deployment. In
discussing these challenges, our design enquiry opens up a space to make sense
of experience living with complex mental health conditions in highly
constrained contexts within which the deployment of the Spheres becomes an
opportunity to think about wellbeing in similar contexts.

testing a technology mock up and lo-fidelity prototype fed into the design of a
final high-spec prototype. The Haptic Wave was tested in the laboratory, then
deployed in real world settings in recording studios and audio production
facilities. The cross-modal mapping is kinesthetic and allows the direct
manipulation of sound without the translation of an existing visual interface.
The research gleans insight into working with users with visual impairments,

%X Sensory Substitution Devices (SSDs) convert visual information into another
sensory channel (e.g. sound) to improve the everyday functioning of blind and
visually impaired persons (BVIP). However, the range of possible functions and
options for translating vision into sound is largely open-ended. To provide
constraints on the design of this technology, we interviewed ten BVIPs who were
briefly trained in the use of three novel devices that, collectively, showcase
a large range of design permutations. The SSDs include the 'Depth-vOICe,'
'Synaestheatre' and 'Creole' that offer high spatial, temporal, and colour
resolutions respectively via a variety of sound outputs (electronic tones,
instruments, vocals). The participants identified a range of practical concerns
in relation to the devices (e.g. curb detection, recognition, mental effort)
but also highlighted experiential aspects. This included both curiosity about
the visual world (e.g. understanding shades of colour, the shape of cars,
seeing the night sky) and the desire for the substituting sound to be
responsive to movement of the device and aesthetically engaging.

%X For visually impaired users, making sense of spatial information is
difficult as they have to scan and memorize content before being able to
analyze it. Even worse, any update to the displayed content invalidates their
spatial memory, which can force them to manually rescan the entire display.
Making display contents persist, we argue, is thus the highest priority in
designing a sensemaking system for the visually impaired. We present a tactile
display system designed with this goal in mind. The foundation of our system is
a large tactile display (140x100cm, 23x larger than Hyperbraille), which we
achieve by using a 3D printer to print raised lines of filament. The system's
software then trades in this space in order to minimize screen updates. Instead
of panning and zooming, for example, our system creates additional views,
leaving display contents intact and thus supporting users in preserving their
spatial memory. We illustrate our system and its design principles at the
example of four spatial applications. We evaluated our system with six blind
users. Participants responded favorably to the system and expressed, for
example, that having multiple views at the same time was helpful. They also
judged the increased expressiveness of lines over the more traditional dots as
useful for encoding information.

%X Maps are essential in everyday life, but inherently inaccessible to visually
impaired users. They must be transcribed to non-editable tactile graphics, or
rendered on very expensive shape changing displays. To tackle these issues, we
developed a tangible tabletop interface that enables visually impaired users to
build tangible maps on their own, using a new type of physical icon called
Tangible Reels. Tangible Reels are composed of a sucker pad that ensures
stability, with a retractable reel that renders digital lines tangible. In
order to construct a map, audio instructions guide the user to precisely place
Tangible Reels onto the table and create links between them. During subsequent
exploration, the device provides the names of the points and lines that the
user touches. A pre-study confirmed that Tangible Reels are stable and easy to
manipulate, and that visually impaired users can understand maps that are built
with them. A follow-up experiment validated that the designed system, including
non-visual interactions, enables visually impaired participants to quickly
build and explore maps of various complexities.

infrastructure development project in the ocean sciences experiencing a scale
downward and threat of further defunding, I highlight four often overlooked
components of innovation and development that have important implications for
the HCI community. The first debunks the mythical liquidation and restart of
Western development's "fail fast, fail often" mantra by tracing the
complexities of breaking down an infrastructure, highlighting that the end of a
technology is entrenched in longer-lived social, political and organizational
consequences. The second dives deeper into these social consequences, as
formalized structures are broken down and new temporary and contingent working
orders surface to fill their place. Third, I signal the critical consequences
of the thoughtful practices of assessment and evaluation of both human and
material resources that occur during the downturn of systems. Last, I discuss
the deeply personal connections that amplify through processes of breaking down
systems.

%X This paper investigates emerging practices and infrastructures in global
humanitarian relief to argue for logistics as an essential but often neglected
component of ICTD and broader HCI work. Logistics -- the artful coordination of
human and material flows -- leverages scholarship on "coordination,"
"articulation" and "infrastructure" to provide insight into the complex role of
new IT systems (and HCI as a field) in the global circulation of goods and
relations. Drawing on fieldwork with the UNICEF Supply Division, we argue that
contemporary logistics operates simultaneously as a form of care and control.
We demonstrate that logisticians at Supply traverse messy and dynamic
information and material infrastructures, and that effective logistical work
must marry and bridge these worlds. Our work extends ICTD and postcolonial
computing research by casting light on the nature, experience and ambivalence
of the global flows that enable and support HCI work in development and
postcolonial settings.

%X HCI shapes in important ways dominant notions of what counts as innovation
and where (good) design is located. In this paper, we argue for the continuous
expansion of the body of critical and reflexive work that asks both researcher
and designer to reflect on their values of design in the world. Drawing from
ethnographic research in Accra, Ghana and Shenzhen, China, we illustrate how
design is as much about making artifacts as it is about producing national
identity, reputation, and economic gain. Technology entrepreneurs take from and
resist the discourse of their cities as emerging sites of Silicon-Valley type
innovation. They render the narrative of "catching up with the west" overly
simplistic, ahistorical and blind to situated practices of design. This view,
we argue, is critical for interrogating our views of design especially as it
becomes more central in the contemporary global economy.

about their awareness of or how they engage in mainstream crowd work. Through
an online survey with 505 seniors, we found that most have never heard of crowd

interesting or stimulating tasks. We follow up results from the survey with
interviews and observations of 14 older adults completing crowd work tasks.
While our survey data suggests that financial incentives are encouraging,
in-depth interviews reveal that a combination of personal and social incentives
may be stronger drivers of participation, but only if older adults can overcome
accessibility issues and understand the purpose of crowd work. This paper
contributes insights into how crowdsourcing sites could better engage seniors

%X Crowdsourcing offers a powerful new paradigm for online work. However, real
world tasks are often interdependent, requiring a big picture view of the
difference pieces involved. Existing crowdsourcing approaches that support such
tasks -- ranging from Wikipedia to flash teams -- are bottlenecked by relying
on a small number of individuals to maintain the big picture. In this paper, we
explore the idea that a computational system can scaffold an emerging
interdependent, big picture view entirely through the small contributions of
individuals, each of whom sees only a part of the whole. To investigate the
viability, strengths, and weaknesses of this approach we instantiate the idea
in a prototype system for accomplishing distributed information synthesis and
evaluate its output across a variety of topics. We also contribute a set of
design patterns that may be informative for other systems aimed at supporting
big picture thinking in small pieces.

%X Online crowd labor markets often address issues of risk and mistrust between
employers and employees from the employers' perspective, but less often from
that of employees. Based on 437 comments posted by crowd workers (Turkers) on
the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) participation agreement, we identified work
rejection as a major risk that Turkers experience. Unfair rejections can result
from poorly-designed tasks, unclear instructions, technical errors, and
malicious Requesters. Because the AMT policy and platform provide little
recourse to Turkers, they adopt strategies to minimize risk: avoiding new and
known bad Requesters, sharing information with other Turkers, and choosing
low-risk tasks. Through a series of ideas inspired by these findings-including
notifying Turkers and Requesters of a broken task, returning rejected work to
Turkers for repair, and providing collective dispute resolution mechanisms-we
argue that making reducing risk and building trust a first-class design goal
can lead to solutions that improve outcomes around rejected work for all
parties in online labor markets.

validate these measures on a controlled virtual environment and show how they
can be used to compare different interaction techniques or devices, by
comparing here a keyboard and a touch-based interface. Thanks to such a
framework, EEG becomes a promising method to improve the overall usability of

%X We present the results of two controlled studies of free-improvised ensemble
music-making on touch-screens. In our system, updates to an interface of
harmonically-selected pitches are broadcast to every touch-screen in response
to either a performer pressing a GUI button, or to interventions from an
intelligent agent. In our first study, analysis of survey results and
performance data indicated significant effects of the button on performer
preference, but of the agent on performance length. In the second follow-up
study, a mixed-initiative interface, where the presence of the button was
interlaced with agent interventions, was developed to leverage both approaches.
Comparison of this mixed-initiative interface with the always-on
button-plus-agent condition of the first study demonstrated significant
preferences for the former. The different approaches were found to shape the
creative interactions that take place. Overall, this research offers evidence
that an intelligent agent and a networked GUI both improve aspects of
improvised ensemble music-making.

despite the large amount of attention it has been given. Using accelerometers
that are widely available in mobile devices, we developed M.Gesture, a software
system that supports accelerometer-based gesture authoring on single or
multiple mobile devices. The development was based on a formative study that
showed users' preferences for subtle, simple motions and synchronized,
multi-device gestures. M.Gesture adopts an acceleration data space and
interface components based on mass-spring analogy and combines the strengths of
both demonstration-based and declarative approaches. Also, gesture declaration
is done by specifying a mass-spring trajectory with planes in the acceleration
space. For iterative gesture modification, multi-level feedbacks are provided
as well. The results of evaluative studies have shown good usability and higher
recognition performance than that of dynamic time warping for simple gesture
authoring. Later, we discuss the benefits of applying a physical metaphor and
hybrid approach.

%X When users want to interact with an in-air gesture system, they must first
address it. This involves finding where to gesture so that their actions can be
sensed, and how to direct their input towards that system so that they do not
also affect others or cause unwanted effects. This is an important problem
which lacks a practical solution. We present an interaction technique which
uses multimodal feedback to help users address in-air gesture systems. The
feedback tells them how ("do that") and where ("there") to gesture, using
light, audio and tactile displays. By doing that there, users can direct their
input to the system they wish to interact with, in a place where their gestures
can be sensed. We discuss the design of our technique and three experiments
investigating its use, finding that users can "do that" well (93.2%-99.9%)
while accurately (51mm-80mm) and quickly (3.7s) finding "there".

%X Practical wearable gesture tracking requires that sensors align with
existing ergonomic device forms. We show that combining EMG and pressure data
sensed only at the wrist can support accurate classification of hand gestures.
A pilot study with unintended EMG electrode pressure variability led to
exploration of the approach in greater depth. The EMPress technique senses both
finger movements and rotations around the wrist and forearm, covering a wide
range of gestures, with an overall 10-fold cross validation classification
accuracy of 96%. We show that EMG is especially suited to sensing finger
movements, that pressure is suited to sensing wrist and forearm rotations, and
their combination is significantly more accurate for a range of gestures than
either technique alone. The technique is well suited to existing wearable
device forms such as smart watches that are already mounted on the wrist.

%X Mid-air gestures offer a promising way to interact with large public
displays. User representations are important to attract people to such
displays, convey interactivity and provide meaningful gesture feedback. We
evaluated two forms of user representation, an abstract skeleton and a
silhouette, at a large public information display. Results from 56 days, with
190 sessions involving 483 detected people, indicate the silhouette attracted
more passers-by to interact and, of these, more engaged in serious browsing
interactions. By contrast, the skeleton representation had more playful
interactions. Our work contributes to the understanding of the implications of
these choices of user representation.

%X We propose a novel sensing technique called proactive sensing. Proactive
sensing continually repositions a camera-based sensor as a way to improve hand
pose estimation. Our core contribution is a scheme that effectively learns how
to move the sensor to improve pose estimation confidence while requiring no
ground truth hand poses. We demonstrate this concept using a low-cost rapid
swing arm system built around the state-of-the-art commercial sensing system
Leap Motion. The results from our user study show that proactive sensing helps
estimate users' hand poses with higher confidence compared to both static and
random sensing. We further present an online model update to improve
performance for each user.

%X Many online platforms use curation algorithms that are opaque to the user.
Recent work suggests that discovering a filtering algorithm's existence in a
curated feed influences user experience, but it remains unclear how users
reason about the operation of these algorithms. In this qualitative laboratory
study, researchers interviewed a diverse, non-probability sample of 40 Facebook
users before, during, and after being presented alternative displays of
Facebook's News Feed curation algorithm's output. Interviews revealed 10 "folk
theories' of automated curation, some quite unexpected. Users who were given a
probe into the algorithm's operation via an interface that incorporated
"seams,' visible hints disclosing aspects of automation operations, could
quickly develop theories. Users made plans that depended on their theories. We
conclude that foregrounding these automated processes may increase interface
design complexity, but it may also add usability benefits.

%X Ranking users in social networks is a well-studied problem, typically solved
by algorithms that leverage network structure to identify influential users and
recommend people to follow. In the last decade, however, curation -- users
sharing and promoting content in a network -- has become a central social
activity, as platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and GitHub drive
growth and engagement by connecting users through content and content to users.
While existing algorithms reward users that are highly active with higher
rankings, they fail to account for users' curatorial taste. This paper
introduces CuRank, an algorithm for ranking users and content in social
networks by explicitly modeling three characteristics of a good curator:
discerning taste, high activity, and timeliness. We evaluate CuRank on datasets
from two popular social networks -- GitHub and Vine -- and demonstrate its
efficacy at ranking content and identifying good curators.

%X The rising prevalence of algorithmic interfaces, such as curated feeds in
online news, raises new questions for designers, scholars, and critics of
media. This work focuses on how transparent design of algorithmic interfaces
can promote awareness and foster trust. A two-stage process of how transparency
affects trust was hypothesized drawing on theories of information processing
and procedural justice. In an online field experiment, three levels of system
transparency were tested in the high-stakes context of peer assessment.
Individuals whose expectations were violated (by receiving a lower grade than
expected) trusted the system less, unless the grading algorithm was made more
transparent through explanation. However, providing too much information eroded
this trust. Attitudes of individuals whose expectations were met did not vary
with transparency. Results are discussed in terms of a dual process model of
attitude change and the depth of justification of perceived inconsistency.
Designing for trust requires balanced interface transparency -- not too little
and not too much.

structures in social networks. These algorithms have been studied from the
perspective of optimisation extensively. However, which community finding
algorithm most closely matches the human notion of communities? In this paper,
we conduct a user study to address this question. In our experiment, users
collected their own Facebook network and manually annotated it, indicating
their social communities. Given this annotation, we run state-of-the-art
community finding algorithms on the network and use Normalised Mutual
Information (NMI) to compare annotated communities with automatically detected
ones. Our results show that the Infomap algorithm has the greatest similarity
to user defined communities, with Girvan-Newman and Louvain algorithms also
performing well.

%X Sociologists and political scientists have drawn attention to the importance
of hashtags as tools for political organizing and protest online. Examining a
set of political hashtags on Tumblr, we discover linguistic changes in the ways
that the hashtags are used over time. As time passes, the community uses a more
diverse vocabulary of hashtags in conjunction with the central political tag,
suggesting that the meaning of the tag expands or proliferates -- a phenomenon
we dub hashtag drift. We also find evidence that this occurs not just on the
level of the community but at the level of individual users who, as time
progresses, use the hashtag in conjunction with a more diverse vocabulary of
other tags. This study sheds light on the dynamics of political engagement
through hashtag activism.

%X Proliferation of small computing-enabled devices coupled with the richness
of communication infrastructure has made location-based computing a reality.
Location-based reminders (LBRs) provide alarms and notices to users based on
their location. These are typically used to remind us to complete a to-do task
at a particular location. The current design of LBRs fails to take advantage of
prospective memory theory. We hypothesize that if the encoding stage provides a
closer match to the retrieval stage, then location recognition and task recall
in LBRs will improve at retrieval time. We conducted a between subjects
experiment and measured performance as location recognition and task recall. We
found strong evidence in support that a first-person view benefits prospective
remembering the most. We close with a discussion of the implications for the
design of the encoding stage for future LBR systems.

fieldwork and interviews, we highlight the ways in which staff and volunteers
assembled and presented different forms of evidence, in doing so reframing what
is conceived as 'valid knowledge'. We note the challenges this group faced in
capturing experiential knowledge around the accessibility barriers of public
transport, and the trade-offs that are made when presenting evidence to policy

%X Mobile social matching systems aim to bring people together in the physical
world by recommending people nearby to each other. Going beyond simple
similarity and proximity matching mechanisms, we explore a proposed framework
of relational, social and personal context as predictors of match opportunities
to map out the design space of opportunistic social matching systems. We
contribute insights gained from a study combining Experience Sampling Method
(ESM) with 85 students of a U.S. university and interviews with 15 of these
participants. A generalized linear mixed model analysis (n=1704) showed that
personal context (mood and busyness) as well as sociability of others nearby
are the strongest predictors of contextual match interest. Participant
interviews suggest operationalizing relational context using social network
rarity and discoverable rarity, and incorporating skill level and
learning/teaching needs for activity partnering. Based on these findings we
propose passive context-awareness for opportunistic social matching.

%X The lack of certain types of geographic data prevents the development of
location-aware technologies in a number of important domains. One such type of
"unmapped" geographic data is space usage rules (SURs), which are defined as
geographically-bound activity restrictions (e.g. "no dogs", "no smoking", "no
fishing", "no skateboarding"). Researchers in the area of human-computer
interaction have recently begun to develop techniques for the automated mapping
of SURs with the aim of supporting activity planning systems (e.g. one-touch
"Can I Smoke Here?" apps, SUR-aware vacation planning tools). In this paper, we
present a novel SUR mapping technique -- SPtP -- that outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches by 30% for one of the most important components of
the SUR mapping pipeline: associating a point observation of a SUR (e.g. a 'no
smoking' sign) with the corresponding polygon in which the SUR applies (e.g.
the nearby park or the entire campus on which the sign is located). This paper
also contributes a series of new SUR benchmark datasets to help further
research in this area.

%X Synchronous colocated collaborative sensemaking requires that analysts share
their information and insights with each other. The challenge is to know when
is the right time to share what information without disrupting the present
state of analysis. This is crucial in ad-hoc sensemaking sessions with mobile
devices because small screen space limits information display. To address these
tensions, we propose and evaluate RAMPARTS -- a spatially aware sensemaking
system for collaborative crime analysis that aims to support faster information
sharing, clue-finding, and analysis. We compare RAMPARTS to an interactive
tabletop and a paper-based method in a controlled laboratory study. We found
that RAMPARTS significantly decreased task completion time compared to paper,
without affecting cognitive load or task completion time adversely compared to
an interactive tabletop. We conclude that designing for ad-hoc colocated
sensemaking on mobile devices could benefit from spatial awareness. In
particular, spatial awareness could be used to identify relevant information,
support diverse alignment styles for visual comparison, and enable alternative
rhythms of sensemaking.

Results demonstrate that perceived distance explains when geographic dispersion
benefits teams high in perceived diversity. Results also indicate that the type
of perceived diversity matters (surface-level vs. deep-level diversity). This
study contributes to our understanding of distance and diversity in teams.

accomplish mobile living, the values they place in technology for doing
'family' at a distance and to draw insights in to the potential roles of

a spreadsheet tool for using and exploring hierarchical datasets. We introduce
novel interaction techniques and algorithms to manipulate and visualize
hierarchical data in a spreadsheet using the data's relative hierarchical
relationships with the data in its adjacent columns. Our tool leverages the
data's structural information to support selecting, grouping, joining, sorting
and filtering hierarchical data in spreadsheets. Our lab study showed that our
tool helped spreadsheet users complete data exploration tasks nearly two times

use-cases without requiring deep knowledge in either quadrotor control or the
underlying constraints of the target domain. To achieve this goal we propose an
optimization-based method that generates feasible trajectories which can be
flown in the real world. Furthermore, the method incorporates high-level human
objectives into the planning of flight trajectories. An easy to use 3D design
tool allows for quick specification and editing of trajectories as well as for
intuitive exploration of the resulting solution space. We demonstrate the
utility of our approach in several real-world application scenarios, including
aerial-videography, robotic light-painting and drone racing.

%X Color enhancement is a very important aspect of photo editing. Even when
photographers have tens of or hundreds of photographs, they must enhance each
photo one by one by manually tweaking sliders in software such as brightness
and contrast, because automatic color enhancement is not always satisfactory
for them. To support this repetitive manual task, we present self-reinforcing
color enhancement, where the system implicitly and progressively learns the
user's preferences by training on their photo editing history. The more photos
the user enhances, the more effectively the system supports the user. We
present a working prototype system called SelPh, and then describe the
algorithms used to perform the self-reinforcement. We conduct a user study to
investigate how photographers would use a self-reinforcing system to enhance a
collection of photos. The results indicate that the participants were satisfied
with the proposed system and strongly agreed that the self-reinforcing approach
is preferable to the traditional workflow.

address four: The continuous dynamic development of experiences; the
multiplicity and complexity involved; the distinction between "real" and
"virtual" experiences, and finally applying descriptive concepts predictively.
Based on our background in activity theoretical HCI we discuss two cases to
nuance the discussion of conceptual blends and HCI. We provide an understanding
of conceptual blends beyond one-to-one static blends, and immediately
recognizable concepts. We focus on multiplicity, dynamics and learning, and in
that we provide a more advanced methodological scaffolding of analyses of
conceptual blends, hence we propose that designers need to seed blends in
design.

%X Prototypes and prototyping have had a long and important history in the HCI
community and have played a highly significant role in creating technology that
is easier and more fulfilling to use. Yet, as focus in HCI is expanding to
investigate complex matters of human relationships with technology over time in
the intimate and contested contexts of everyday life, the notion of a
'prototype' may not be fully sufficient to support these kinds of inquiries. We
propose the research product as an extension and evolution of the research
prototype to support generative inquiries in this emerging research area. We
articulate four interrelated qualities of research products inquiry-driven,
finish, fit, and independent and draw on these qualities to describe and
analyze five different yet related design research cases we have collectively
conducted over the past six years. We conclude with a discussion of challenges
and opportunities for crafting research products and the implications they
suggest for future design-oriented HCI research.

tools and approaches for addressing the main challenges for HCI practitioners
working in this field. While previous influential contributions within Media
Architecture have identified challenges for designers and offered case studies
of specific approaches, here, we (1) provide guidance on how to tackle the
domain-specific challenges of Media Architecture design -- pertaining to the
interface, integration, content, context, process, prototyping, and evaluation
-- on the basis of the development of numerous installations over the course of
seven years, and thorough studies of related work, and (2) present five
categories of tools and approaches -- software tools, projection, 3D models,
hardware prototyping, and evaluation tools -- developed to address these
challenges in practice, exemplified through six concrete examples from
real-life cases.

%X Rarely are computing systems developed entirely by members of the
communities they serve, particularly when that community is underrepresented in
computing. Archive of Our Own (AO3), a fan fiction archive with nearly 750,000
users and over 2 million individual works, was designed and coded primarily by
women to meet the needs of the online fandom community. Their design decisions
were informed by existing values and norms around issues such as accessibility,
inclusivity, and identity. We conducted interviews with 28 users and
developers, and with this data we detail the history and design of AO3 using
the framework of feminist HCI and focusing on the successful incorporation of
values into design. We conclude with considering examples of complexity in
values in design work: the use of design to mitigate tensions in values and to
influence value formation or change.

but one potentially critical factor has mostly been overlooked -- software
itself. To help close this gap, we recently created GenderMag, a systematic
inspection method to enable software practitioners to evaluate their software
for issues of gender-inclusiveness. In this paper, we present the first
real-world investigation of software practitioners' ability to identify
gender-inclusiveness issues in software they create/maintain using this method.
Our investigation was a multiple-case field study of software teams at three
major U.S. technology organizations. The results were that, using GenderMag to
evaluate software, these software practitioners identified a surprisingly high
number of gender-inclusiveness issues: 25% of the software features they
evaluated had gender-inclusiveness issues.

illustrate the experience of women's health both from the perspective of the

crucial roles in remedial women's care practices, as well as preventative. In
describing these challenges we deliberate on possible futures of women's health
that take advantage of the many advances in design and technology from across
the spectrum of HCI research. We show how with some care and courage HCI has
the potential to transform women's experience within this setting.

opportunities for a range of additional supportive technologies. We close with

%X We explore how crowdworkers can be trained to tackle complex crowdsourcing
tasks. We are particularly interested in training novice workers to perform
well on solving tasks in situations where the space of strategies is large and
workers need to discover and try different strategies to be successful. In a
first experiment, we perform a comparison of five different training
strategies. For complex web search challenges, we show that providing expert
examples is an effective form of training, surpassing other forms of training
in nearly all measures of interest. However, such training relies on access to
domain expertise, which may be expensive or lacking. Therefore, in a second
experiment we study the feasibility of training workers in the absence of
domain expertise. We show that having workers validate the work of their peer
workers can be even more effective than having them review expert examples if
we only present solutions filtered by a threshold length. The results suggest
that crowdsourced solutions of peer workers may be harnessed in an automated
training pipeline.

%X Crowd work provides solutions to complex problems effectively, efficiently,
and at low cost. Previous research showed that feedback, particularly
correctness feedback can help crowd workers improve their performance; yet such
feedback, particularly when generated by experts, is costly and difficult to
scale. In our research we investigate approaches to facilitating continuous
observational learning in crowdsourcing communities. In a study conducted with
workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we asked workers to complete a set of tasks
identifying nutritional composition of different meals. We examined workers'
accuracy gains after being exposed to expert-generated feedback and to two
types of peer-generated feedback: direct accuracy assessment with explanations
of errors, and a comparison with solutions generated by other workers. The
study further confirmed that expert-generated feedback is a powerful mechanism
for facilitating learning and leads to significant gains in accuracy. However,
the study also showed that comparing one's own solutions with a variety of
solutions suggested by others and their comparative frequencies leads to
significant gains in accuracy. This solution is particularly attractive because
of its low cost, minimal impact on time and cost of job completion, and high
potential for adoption by a variety of crowdsourcing platforms.

%X Expert crowdsourcing marketplaces have untapped potential to empower
workers' career and skill development. Currently, many workers cannot afford to
invest the time and sacrifice the earnings required to learn a new skill, and a
lack of experience makes it difficult to get job offers even if they do. In
this paper, we seek to lower the threshold to skill development by repurposing
existing tasks on the marketplace as mentored, paid, real-world work
experiences, which we refer to as micro-internships. We instantiate this idea
in Atelier, a micro-internship platform that connects crowd interns with crowd
mentors. Atelier guides mentor-intern pairs to break down expert crowdsourcing
tasks into milestones, review intermediate output, and problem-solve together.
We conducted a field experiment comparing Atelier's mentorship model to a
non-mentored alternative on a real-world programming crowdsourcing task,
finding that Atelier helped interns maintain forward progress and absorb best
practices.

%X This paper presents the MicroWriter, a system that decomposes the task of
writing into three types of microtasks to produce a single report: 1)
generating ideas, 2) labeling ideas to organize them, and 3) writing paragraphs
given a few related ideas. Because each microtask can be completed individually
with limited awareness of what has been already done and what others are doing,
this decomposition can change the experience of collaborative writing. Prior
work has used microtasking to support collaborative writing with unaffiliated
crowd workers. To instead study its impact on collaboration among writers with
context and investment in the writing project, we asked six groups of
co-workers (or 19 people in total) to use the MicroWriter in a synchronous,
collocated setting to write a report about a shared work goal. Our observations
suggest ways that recent advances in microtasking and crowd work can be used to
support collaborative writing within preexisting groups.

%X Non-digital forms of play that allow players to direct brute force directly
upon each other, such as martial arts, boxing and full contact team sports, are
very popular. However, inter-player brutality has largely been unexplored as a
feature of digital gaming. In this paper, we describe the design and study of 2
multi-player games that encourage players to use brute force directly against
other players. Balance of Power is a tug-of-war style game implemented with
Xbox Kinect, while Bundle is a playground-inspired chasing game implemented
with smartphones. Two groups of five participants (n=10) played both games
while being filmed, and were subsequently interviewed. A thematic analysis
identified five key components of the brutal multiplayer video game experience,
which informs a set of seven design considerations. This work aims to inspire
the design of engaging game experiences based on awareness and enjoyment of our
own and others' physicality.

Exergame users consistently require new content to maintain interest in the
activity. One way to provide users with high quality content with minimal
development work is to convert existing off-the-shelf digital games into
exergames by using the game's "modding" interface. To explore the potential of
converted exergames for inspiring high exertion levels we performed a
conversion on two popular games: Half-Life 2 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.
The conversions were performed in two stages. The first stage mimics existing
conversion techniques and a second stage provides added incentive for players
to reach higher exertion levels. A study of 18 participants found that the
resulting games support anti-sedentary levels of exertion while falling
slightly below national recommendations for cardiovascular exercise. Adding
exercise to the games did not affect players' enjoyment.

%X Users frequently experience situations in which their ability to
differentiate screen colors is affected by a diversity of situations, such as
when bright sunlight causes glare, or when monitors are dimly lit. However,
designers currently have no way of choosing colors that will be differentiable
by users of various demographic backgrounds and abilities and in the wide range
of situations where their designs may be viewed. Our goal is to provide
designers with insight into the effect of real-world situational lighting
conditions on people's ability to differentiate colors in applications and
imagery. We therefore developed an online color differentiation test that
includes a survey of situational lighting conditions, verified our test in a
lab study, and deployed it in an online environment where we collected data
from around 30,000 participants. We then created ColorCheck, an
image-processing tool that shows designers the proportion of the population
they include (or exclude) by their color choices.

the literacy, language, skills and tools to produce a documentary through

the documentary film commissioning process to community contributors by
developing a framework which instructs, guides and informs non-professional
contributors in capturing the content required for making videos. Through the
results of an in-the-wild deployment we discuss how our framework scaffolds
content creation, the capture of high quality footage and coordination amongst
teams of contributors. We then discuss how this can inform community media
creation in the future.

%X Large-scale idea generation platforms often expose ideators to previous
ideas. However, research suggests people generate better ideas if they see
abstracted solution paths (e.g., descriptions of solution approaches generated
through human sensemaking) rather than being inundated with all prior ideas.
Automated and semi-automated methods can also offer interpretations of earlier
ideas. To benefit from sensemaking in practice with limited resources, ideation
platform developers need to weigh the cost-quality tradeoffs of different
methods for surfacing solution paths. To explore this, we conducted an online
study where 245 participants generated ideas for two problems in one of five
conditions: 1) no stimuli, 2) exposure to all prior ideas, or solution paths
extracted from prior ideas using 3) a fully automated workflow, 4) a hybrid
human-machine approach, and 5) a fully manual approach. Contrary to
expectations, human-generated paths did not improve ideation (as measured by
fluency and breadth of ideation) over simply showing all ideas.
Machine-generated paths sometimes significantly improved fluency and breadth of
ideation over no ideas (although at some cost to idea quality). These findings
suggest that automated sensemaking can improve idea generation, but we need
more research to understand the value of human sensemaking for crowd ideation.

Is a billion dollar budget cut large or small? Advocates of scientific and
civic literacy are concerned with improving how people estimate and comprehend
risks, measurements, and frequencies, but relatively little progress has been
made in this direction. In this article we describe and test a framework to
help people comprehend numerical measurements in everyday settings through
simple sentences, termed perspectives, that employ ratios, ranks, and unit
changes to make them easier to understand. We use a crowdsourced system to
generate perspectives for a wide range of numbers taken from online news
articles. We then test the effectiveness of these perspectives in three
randomized, online experiments involving over 3,200 participants. We find that
perspective clauses substantially improve people's ability to recall
measurements they have read, estimate ones they have not, and detect errors in
manipulated measurements. We see this as the first of many steps in leveraging
digital platforms to improve numeracy among online readers.

%X Shape-changing interfaces allow designers to create user interfaces that
physically change shape. However, presently, we lack studies of how such
interfaces are designed, as well as what high-level strategies, such as
metaphors and affordances, designers use. This paper presents an analysis of
sketches made by 21 participants designing either a shape-changing radio or a
shape-changing mobile phone. The results exhibit a range of interesting design
elements, and the analysis points to a need to further develop or revise
existing vocabularies for sketching and analyzing movement. The sketches show a
prevalent use of metaphors, say, for communicating volume though big-is-on and
small-is-off, as well as a lack of conventions. Furthermore, the affordances
used were curiously asymmetrical compared to those offered by
non-shape-changing interfaces. We conclude by offering implications on how our
results can influence future research on shape-changing interfaces.

%X Research on shape-changing interfaces has explored various technologies,
parameters for shape changes, and transformations between shapes. While much is
known about how to implement these variations, it is unclear what affordance
they provide, how users understand their relation to the underlying system
state, and how feedback via shape change is perceived. We investigated this by
studying how 15 participants perceived and used 13 shape-changing buttons. The
buttons covered several aspects of affordance, system state, and feedback,
including invite-to-touch movements, two styles of transition animation, and
two actuation technologies. Participants explored and interacted with the
buttons while thinking aloud. The results show that affordances are hard to
communicate clearly with shape change; while some movements invited actions,
others were seen as a malfunction. The best clue as to button state was
provided by the position of the button in combination with vibration. Linear
transition animation for changes in button state was the best received form of
shape-change feedback. We discuss also how these findings can inform the design
of shape-changing interfaces more generally.

%X Shape changing interfaces give physical shapes to digital data so that users
can feel and manipulate data with their hands and bodies. However, physical
objects in our daily life not only have shape but also various material
properties. In this paper, we propose an interaction technique to represent
material properties using shape changing interfaces. Specifically, by
integrating the multi-modal sensation techniques of haptics, our approach
builds a perceptive model for the properties of deformable materials in
response to direct manipulation. As a proof-of-concept prototype, we developed
preliminary physics algorithms running on pin-based shape displays. The system
can create computationally variable properties of deformable materials that are
visually and physically perceivable. In our experiments, users identify three
deformable material properties (flexibility, elasticity and viscosity) through
direct touch interaction with the shape display and its dynamic movements. In
this paper, we describe interaction techniques, our implementation, future
applications and evaluation on how users differentiate between specific
properties of our system. Our research shows that shape changing interfaces can
go beyond simply displaying shape allowing for rich embodied interaction and
perceptions of rendered materials with the hands and body.

%X The present research investigated whether digital and non-digital platforms
activate differing default levels of cognitive construal. Two initial
randomized experiments revealed that individuals who completed the same
information processing task on a digital mobile device (a tablet or laptop
computer) versus a non-digital platform (a physical print-out) exhibited a
lower level of construal, one prioritizing immediate, concrete details over
abstract, decontextualized interpretations. This pattern emerged both in
digital platform participants' greater preference for concrete versus abstract
descriptions of behaviors as well as superior performance on detail-focused
items (and inferior performance on inference-focused items) on a reading
comprehension assessment. A pair of final studies found that the likelihood of
correctly solving a problem-solving task requiring higher-level "gist"
processing was: (1) higher for participants who processed the information for
task on a non-digital versus digital platform and (2) heightened for digital
platform participants who had first completed an activity activating an
abstract mindset, compared to (equivalent) performance levels exhibited by
participants who had either completed no prior activity or completed an
activity activating a concrete mindset.

%X Shape-changing displays -- visual output surfaces with
physically-reconfigurable geometry -- provide new challenges for content
generation. Content design must incorporate visual elements, physical surface
shape, react to user input, and adapt these parameters over time. The addition
of the 'shape channel' significantly increases the complexity of content
design, but provides a powerful platform for novel physical design, animations,
and physicalizations. In this work we use ShapeCanvas, a 4&times;4 grid of
large actuated pixels, combined with simple interactions, to explore novice
user behavior and interactions for shape-change content design. We deployed
ShapeCanvas in a caf&eacute; for two and a half days and observed users
generate 21 physical animations. These were categorized into seven categories
and eight directly derived from people's personal interest. This paper
describes these experiences, the generated animations and provides initial
insights into shape-changing content design.

%X OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the most widely used volunteer geographic information
system. Although it is increasingly relied upon during humanitarian response as
the most up-to-date, accurate, or accessible map of affected areas, the
behavior of the mappers who contribute to it is not well understood. In this
paper, we explore the work practices and interactions of volunteer mappers
operating in the high-tempo, high-volume context of disasters. To do this, we
built upon and expanded prior network analysis techniques to select high-value
portions of the vast OSM data for further qualitative analysis. We then
performed detailed content analysis of the identified activity and, where
possible, conducted interviews with the participants. This research allowed the
identification of seven distinct mapping practices that can be classified
according to dimensions of time, space, and interpersonal interaction. Our work
represents a baseline for future research about how OSM crisis mapping
practices have evolved over time.

%X Disasters and their impacts have unavoidable spatial characteristics. As
such, maps are necessary and omnipresent features of the information landscapes
that surround and support disaster response. Professional and volunteer GIS
services are increasingly in demand to support map-based information
visualization during crises. This paper investigates the work of mapmakers
working on the response to the 2015 Nepal earthquakes. In comparison to prior
events, we found significantly more collaboration and spatial data sharing took
place between map producers working across humanitarian organizations and parts
of the Nepal government. Collaboration between mapping practitioners was
supported by a complex and emergent information infrastructure composed of
social and technical elements, some of which were brought through experience
with prior disaster events, and some which were shaped anew by the availability
and acceptance of open data sources. Our research investigates these elements
of the spatial information infrastructure in post-earthquake Nepal to consider
infrastructural emergence.

%X With an increased number of both cars and drivers in the world, it is of
great importance to design well-functioning driver support systems for them, in
order to reduce the number of accidents. Despite the fact that the growing
markets can be found in Asia, most advisory traffic information systems (ATIS)
are designed for, and adapted to, the western market, and its predominant
traffic safety cultures (TSCs). However, traffic safety cultures differ between
different parts of the world, and this in turn affects how drivers respond to
advisory traffic information. In our study, we designed an ATIS to accommodate
two different traffic safety cultures. Our findings show that although drivers
belonging to both TSCs drove more safely with our ATIS than without, they still
responded very differently to it, using it to support their different driving
strategies. This implies that the traffic safety culture of the driver cannot
be ignored; ATIS designers need to study and understand the TSC they are
designing for.

%X Smart journals are both an emerging class of lifelogging applications and
novel digital possessions, which are used to create and curate a personal
record of one's life. Through an in-depth interview study of analogue and
digital journaling practices, and by drawing on a wide range of research around
--technologies of memory?, we address fundamental questions about how people
manage and value digital records of the past. Appreciating journaling as deeply
idiographic, we map a broad range of user practices and motivations and use
this understanding to ground four design considerations: recognizing the
motivation to account for one's life; supporting the authoring of a unique
perspective and finding a place for passive tracking as a chronicle. Finally,
we argue that smart journals signal a maturing orientation to issues of digital
archiving.

%X Expressiveness, which we define as the extent to which rich and complex
intent can be conveyed through action, is a vital aspect of many human
interactions. For instance, paint on canvas is said to be an expressive medium,
because it affords the artist the ability to convey multifaceted emotional
intent through intricate manipulations of a brush. To date, touch devices have
failed to offer users a level of expressiveness in their interactions that
rivals that experienced by the painter and those completing other skilled
physical tasks. We investigate how data about hand movement -- provided by a
motion sensor, similar to those found in many smart watches or fitness trackers
-- can be used to expand the expressiveness of touch interactions. We begin by
introducing a conceptual model that formalizes a design space of possible
expressive touch interactions. We then describe and evaluate Expressy, an
approach that uses a wrist-worn inertial measurement unit to detect and
classify qualities of touch interaction that extend beyond those offered by
today's typical sensing hardware. We conclude by describing a number of sample
applications, which demonstrate the enhanced, expressive interaction
capabilities made possible by Expressy.

%X Bimanual pen and touch UIs are mainly based on the direct manipulation
paradigm. Alternatively we propose partially-indirect bimanual input, where
direct pen input is used with the dominant hand, and indirect-touch input with
the non-dominant hand. As direct and indirect inputs do not overlap, users can
interact in the same space without interference. We investigate two
indirect-touch techniques combined with direct pen input: the first redirects
touches to the user's gaze position, and the second redirects touches to the
pen position. In this paper, we present an empirical user study where we
compare both partially-indirect techniques to direct pen and touch input in
bimanual pan, zoom, and ink tasks. Our experimental results show that users are
comparatively fast with the indirect techniques, but more accurate as users can
dynamically change the zoom-target during indirect zoom gestures. Further our
studies reveal that direct and indirect zoom gestures have distinct
characteristics regarding spatial use, gestural use, and bimanual parallelism.

%X We report on the Latency Hammer, a low-cost yet highaccuracy and
high-precision automated tool that measures the interface latency of
touchscreen devices. The Hammer directly measures latency by triggering a
capacitive touch event on a device using an electrically actuated touch
simulator, and a photo sensor to monitor the screen for a visual response. This
allows us to measure the full end-to-end latency of a touchscreen system
exactly as it would be experienced by a user. The Hammer does not require human
interaction to perform a measurement, enabling the acquisition of large
datasets. We present the operating principles of the Hammer, and discuss its
design and construction; full design documents are available online. We also
present a series of tools and equipment that were built to assess and validate
the performance of the Hammer, and demonstrate that it provides reliable
latency measurements.

%X Touchscreens continue to advance including progress towards sensing fingers
proximal to the display. We explore this emerging pre-touch modality via a
self-capacitance touchscreen that can sense multiple fingers above a mobile
device, as well as grip around the screen's edges. This capability opens up
many possibilities for mobile interaction. For example, using pre-touch in an
anticipatory role affords an "ad-lib interface" that fades in a different UI --
appropriate to the context -- as the user approaches one-handed with a thumb,
two-handed with an index finger, or even with a pinch or two thumbs. Or we can
interpret pre-touch in a retroactive manner that leverages the approach
trajectory to discern whether the user made contact with a ballistic vs. a
finely-targeted motion. Pre-touch also enables hybrid touch + hover gestures,
such as selecting an icon with the thumb while bringing a second finger into
range to invoke a context menu at a convenient location. Collectively these
techniques illustrate how pre-touch sensing offers an intriguing new
back-channel for mobile interaction.

%X This paper reports on a qualitative interview study of ICT use amongst a
population undergoing transition following a life disruption. We interviewed 13
veterans who were re-integrating into civil society. Veterans are unique in
that they experience several transitions at once-that is, after returning home,
they often suffer from PTSD, become homeless, change occupations, etc. Amongst
other things, veterans often undergo identity crises as caused by the lack of
continuity between military and civilian social structures. We show how
veterans are resilient through their uses of ICTs when navigating identity
crises. We find that they use ICTs to develop identity awareness-that is, they
connect with a human infrastructure through which they can develop a "big
picture" understanding of unfamiliar rules and norms and receive support when
navigating civil society. We discuss the implications of our study and identify
implications for design.

%X Digital artifacts on social media can challenge individuals during identity
transitions, particularly those who prefer to delete, separate from, or hide
data that are representative of a past identity. This work investigates
concerns and practices reported by transgender people who transitioned while
active on Facebook. We analyze open-ended survey responses from 283
participants, highlighting types of data considered problematic when separating
oneself from a past identity, and challenges and strategies people engage in
when managing personal data in a networked environment. We find that people
shape their digital footprints in two ways: by editing the self-presentational
data that is representative of a prior identity, and by managing the
configuration of people who have access to that self-presentation. We outline
the challenging interplay between shifting identities, social networks, and the
data that suture them together. We apply these results to a discussion of the
complexities of managing and forgetting the digital past.

%X Post-mortem profiles on social network sites serve as both an archive of the
deceased person's life and a gathering place for friends and loved ones. Many
existing systems utilize inheritance as a model for post-mortem data
management. However, the social and networked nature of personal data on social
media, as well as the memorializing practices in which friends engage, indicate
that other approaches are necessary. In this paper, we articulate the design
choices made throughout the development of Legacy Contact, a post-mortem data
management solution designed and deployed at Facebook. Building on the duties
and responsibilities identified by Brubaker et al., we describe how Legacy
Contact was designed to honor last requests, provide information surrounding
death, preserve the memory of the deceased, and facilitate memorializing
practices. We provide details around the design of the Legacy Contact selection
process, the functionality provided to legacy contacts after accounts have been
memorialized, and changes made to post-mortem profiles.

%X A number of digital platforms and services have recently emerged that allow
users to create posthumous forms of communication, effectively arranging for
the delivery of messages from "beyond the grave". Despite some evidence of
interest and popularity of these services, little is known about how posthumous
messages may impact the people who receive them. We present a qualitative study
that explores the type of experiences potentially triggered upon receiving such
messages. Our findings firstly suggest that posthumous messaging services have
the potential to alter the relationship between the bereaved and the deceased,
and secondly provide insight into how users make sense of this altered
relationship. Through the inference of a set of design considerations for
posthumous communication services, we reveal a number of conflicts that are not
easily solvable through technological means alone, and which may serve as
starting points for further research. Our work extends the growing body of
research that is concerned with digital interactions related to death and
dying.

formed, how locations for devices were determined, and the ways in which the

challenges for HCI and civic technology research going forward, related to the
role of the researcher, the messiness of decision making in communities, and
the ability of community organisations to influence how citizens participate in

leaders in a large US city conceptualize civic tech, in particular, how they
approach the intersection of data, design and civics. We encountered a range of
overlapping voices, from providers, to connectors, to volunteers of civic
services and resources. Through this account, we identified different
conceptions and expectation of data, design and civics, as well as several
shared issues around pressing problems and strategic aspirations. Reflecting on
this set of issues produced guiding questions, in particular about the current
and possible roles for design, to advance civic tech.

the enjoyment that people experience when using technology, but can also
translate into more invested effort. We propose that identifying with an avatar
in a game will increase the intrinsic motivation of the player. We analyzed
data from 126 participants playing a custom endless runner game and show that
similarity identification, embodied identification, and wishful identification
increases autonomy, immersion, invested effort, enjoyment, and positive affect.
We also show that greater identification translates into motivated behaviour as
operationalized by the time that players spent in an unending version of the
infinite runner. Important for the design of games for entertainment and
serious purposes, we discuss how identification with an avatar can be
facilitated to cultivate intrinsic motivation within and beyond games.

%X Emotions are key to the player experience (PX) and interest in the potential
of games to provide unique emotional, sometimes uncomfortable experiences is
growing. Yet there has been little empirical investigation of what game
experiences players consider emotionally moving, their causes and effects, and
whether players find these experiences rewarding at all. We analyzed 121
players' accounts of emotionally moving game experiences in terms of the
feelings and thoughts they evoked, different PX constructs, as well as
game-related and personal factors contributing to these. We found that most
players enjoyed and appreciated experiencing negatively valenced emotions, such
as sadness. Emotions were evoked by a variety of interactive and
non-interactive game aspects, such as in-game loss, character attachment and
(lack of) agency, but also personal memories, and were often accompanied by
(self-)reflection. Our findings highlight the potential of games to provide
emotionally rewarding and thought-provoking experiences, as well as outline
opportunities for future research and design of such experiences. They also
showcase that negative affect may contribute to enjoyment, thereby extending
our notion of positive player experience.

%X The social nature of multiplayer games provides compelling play experiences
that are dynamic, unpredictable, and satisfying; however, playing digital games
with others can result in feeling socially excluded. There are several known
harmful effects of ostracism, including on cognition and the interpretation of
social information. To investigate the effects of social exclusion in the
context of a multiplayer game, we developed and validated a social exclusion
paradigm that we embedded in an online game. Called Operator Challenge, our
paradigm influenced feelings of social exclusion and access to hostile
cognitions (measured through a word-completion task). In addition, the degree
of experienced belonging predicted player enjoyment, effort, and the number of
hostile words completed; however, the experience measures did not mediate the
relationship between belonging and access to hostile cognitions. Our work
facilitates understanding the causes and effects of exclusion, which is
important for the study of player experience in multiplayer games.

better. In this paper, we present the concept of closeness to comparison to
improve the efficacy of social comparison feedback. Specifically, we test two
design strategies related to closeness: (1) comparing users to a target
described as a similarly experienced player and (2) adjusting the visual
representation of performance so player scores appear closer to the comparison
target. We evaluate the effects of these strategies for social comparison on
player performance in an online game. In a controlled experiment with 425
participants, both feedback techniques improved game performance, but only for
experienced players. We conclude with design implications for helping designers
create social comparisons that motivate higher game performance.

%X The 'like' button, introduced by Facebook several years ago, has become one
of the most prominent icons of social media. Similarly to other popular social
media features on the web, enterprises have also recently adopted it. In this
paper, we present a first comprehensive study of liking activity in the
enterprise. We studied the logs of an enterprise social media platform within a
large global organization along a period of seven months, in which 393,720
'likes' were performed. In addition, we conducted a survey of 571 users of the
platform's 'like' button. Our evaluation combines quantitative and qualitative
analysis to inspect what employees like, why they use the 'like' button, and to
whom they give their 'likes'.

%X A critical aspect of formal help-giving tasks in the enterprise is finding
the right expert. We built and evaluated a tool, Find an Expert, to examine
what the most important expert selection criteria are for help-seekers and how
to represent them in expert selection interfaces for formal help-giving tasks.
We observed users' expert selection decisions and found that the diversity of
topic expertise and the amount of related experience were significantly
important in helping users decide which expert to contact. Through
self-reported data from users, we found that in addition to expertise and
experience, expert accessibility indicators, like online availability and
language proficiency, were considered important criteria for selecting experts.
Finally, publicly-displayed crowdsourced ratings of experts, while deemed
useful indicators of expert quality by help-seekers, raised concerns for
experts. We conclude with suggestions regarding the design of expert selection
interfaces for formal help-giving tasks.

%X Break activities -- deliberate and unexpected -- are common throughout the
working day, playing an important role in the wellbeing of workers. This paper
investigates the role of increasingly pervasive ICT in creating new
opportunities for breaks at work, what impact the technology has on management
of boundaries at work, and the effects these changes have on personal
wellbeing. We present a study of the routines of office-workers, where we used
images from participants' work-days to prompt and contextualize interviews with
them. Analysis of coded photographs and interview data makes three
contributions: an account of ubiquitous ICT creating new forms of micro-breaks,
including the opportunity to employ previously wasted time; a description of
the ways in which staff increasingly bring "home to work"; and a discussion of
the emergence of "screen guilt". We evaluate our findings in relation to
previous studies, and leave three research implications and questions for
future work in this domain.

%X While the Quantified Self and personal informatics fields have focused on
the individual's use of self-logged data about themselves, the same kinds of
data could, in theory, be used to improve diagnosis and care planning. In this
paper, we seek to understand both the opportunities and bottlenecks in the use
of self-logged data for differential diagnosis and care planning during patient
visits to both primary and secondary care. We first conducted a literature
review to identify potential factors influencing the use of self-logged data in
clinical settings. This informed the design of our experiment, in which we
applied a vignette-based role-play approach with general practitioners and
hospital specialists in the US and UK, to elicit reflections on and insights
about using patient self-logged data. Our analysis reveals multiple
opportunities for the use of self-logged data in the differential diagnosis
workflow, identifying capture, representational, and interpretational
challenges that are potentially preventing self-logged data from being
effectively interpreted and applied by clinicians to derive a patient's
prognosis and plan of care.

%X This paper explores how interactive technology can help overcome barriers to
active patient participation in audiological consultations involving hearing
aid tuning. We describe the design and evaluation of a prototype sound
simulator intended to trigger reflection in patients regarding their hearing
experiences, and help guide the tuning process. The prototype was tested in
twelve consultations. Our findings suggest that it helped facilitate patient
participation during the tuning process by: (1) encouraging an iterative,
patient-driven approach; (2) stimulating context-specific feedback and
follow-up questions; (3) helping patients make sense of medical information and
treatment actions; (4) offering patient control over the process pace and what
situations to optimize for; and (5) promoting reflections on daily hearing aid
use. Post-consultation interviews revealed that the prototype was perceived
useful in several ways. Our results highlight the benefit of flexible designs
that can be appropriated to fit the spontaneous needs of patients and
audiologists.

%X Internet health information seeking can potentially alter physician-patient
interactions, which in turn can influence healthcare delivery. Investigating
physicians' perceptions about internet-informed patients is important for
understanding this phenomenon in countries like India, where this is a
relatively recent trend. We conducted a qualitative study to this effect,
conceptualizing internet health information access as a disintermediation
process, and examining this phenomenon through the dimensions of meanings
ascribed, power dynamics and social norms. We found that physicians'
perceptions about internet informed patients and their interactions with these
patients were largely adversarial. However, some physicians viewed the
phenomenon as inevitable. They developed methods that leveraged patients'
internet access for the purpose of increasing patient awareness and
self-efficacy. We conceptualize this new role of physicians as apomediation,
and present recommendations for design and implementation of health information
platforms in countries such as India, where power dynamics form a salient part
of physician-patient interactions.

%X Patient engagement leads to better health outcomes and experiences of health
care. However, existing patient engagement systems in the hospital environment
focus on the passive receipt of information by patients rather than the active
contribution of the patient or caregiver as a partner in their care. Through
interviews with hospitalized patients and their caregivers, we identify ways
that patients and caregivers actively participate in their care. We describe
the different roles patients and caregivers assume in interacting with their
hospital care team. We then discuss how systems designed to support patient
engagement in the hospital setting can promote active participation and help
patients achieve better outcomes.

%X Causal Attribution research deals with the explanations people find in
situations of success and failure for why things happened the way they did, and
the extent of control they feel to have over the situation. Attributing success
and failure differently has an impact on our emotions, our motivation, and
behavior. However, so far research on computer-related attributions has not
answered the question whether different attribution patterns influence system
evaluation in usability tests. This question formed the basis for our
investigation. Two standardized questionnaires were used to measure users'
attribution patterns and users' system evaluations. The usability tests were
conducted in our laboratory with N=51 participants. At large, our results
suggest that there are notable influences of users' attribution patterns on
their evaluation of system quality, especially in situations of success.

%X Practicing designers must usually relate to branding in some manner. A
designed artifact must support the brand in a constructive way and help
establish positive brand experiences, which in turn have strategic value for
the brand's institution. While there is obvious application of visual branding
knowledge to the visual form of interactive artifacts, interviews with expert
practitioners reveal a lack of systematic means to craft an interaction
aesthetic to support a brand. Our empirical study relates attributes of
interactive experience to that of 'brand personality', a common way of
quantifying how a brand should be perceived. We show that particular attributes
of interactivity, such as whether an interaction has a continuous rather than
discrete flow, are related to particular brand traits. Our empirical results
establish a clear commercial significance for deeper, systematic ways of
analyzing and critiquing interactive experiences.

Feldenkrais as a resource in our design process, bringing out the Soma Carpet
and Breathing Light applications. Second, through bringing in others to
experience our systems, engaging with and qualitatively analysing their
experiences of our applications. In our third enquiry, we try to pin down what
characterises and sets Somaesthetic Appreciation designs apart through
comparing with and analysing others' design inquiries as well as grounding them
in the somaesthetic theories. We propose that the Somaesthetic Appreciation
designs share a subtleness in how they encourage and spur bodily inquiry in
their choice of interaction modalities, they require an intimate correspondence
-- feedback and interactions that follow the rhythm of the body, they entail a
distinct manner of making space shutting out the outside world --
metaphorically and literally -- to allow users to turn their attention inwards,
and they rely on articulation of bodily experiences to encourage learning and
increased somatic awareness.

%X Microtasks are small units of work designed to be completed individually,
eventually contributing to a larger goal. Although microtasks can be performed
in isolation, in practice people often complete a chain of microtasks within a
single session. Through a series of crowd-based studies, we look at how various
microtasks can be chained together to improve efficiency and minimize mental
demand, focusing on the writing domain. We find that participants completed
low-complexity microtasks faster when they were preceded by the same type of
microtask, whereas they found high-complexity microtasks less mentally
demanding when pre-ceded by microtasks on the same content. Furthermore,
participants were faster at starting high-complexity microtasks after
completing lower-complexity microtasks, but completion time and quality were
not affected. These findings provide insight into how microtasks can be ordered
to optimize transitions from one microtask to another.

%X Microtask platforms are becoming commonplace tools for performing human
research, producing gold-standard data, and annotating large datasets. These
platforms connect requesters (researchers or companies) with large populations
(crowds) of workers, who perform small tasks, typically taking less than five
minutes each. A topic of ongoing research concerns the design of tasks that
elicit high quality annotations. Here we identify a seemingly banal feature of
nearly all crowdsourcing workflows that profoundly impacts workers' responses.
Microtask assignments typically consist of a sequence of tasks sharing a common
format (e.g., circle galaxies in an image). Using image-labeling, a canonical
microtask format, we show that earlier tasks can have a strong influence on
responses to later tasks, shifting the distribution of future responses by
30-50% (total variational distance). Specifically, prior tasks influence the
content that workers focus on, as well as the richness and specialization of
responses. We call this phenomenon intertask effects. We compare intertask
effects to framing, effected by stating the requester's research interest, and
find that intertask effects are on par or stronger. If uncontrolled, intertask
effects could be a source of systematic bias, but our results suggest that,
with appropriate task design, they might be leveraged to hone worker focus and
acuity, helping to elicit reproducible, expert-level judgments. Intertask
effects are a crucial aspect of human computation that should be considered in
the design of any crowdsourced study.

%X Microtask crowdsourcing has enabled dataset advances in social science and
machine learning, but existing crowdsourcing schemes are too expensive to scale
up with the expanding volume of data. To scale and widen the applicability of
crowdsourcing, we present a technique that produces extremely rapid judgments
for binary and categorical labels. Rather than punishing all errors, which
causes workers to proceed slowly and deliberately, our technique speeds up
workers' judgments to the point where errors are acceptable and even expected.
We demonstrate that it is possible to rectify these errors by randomizing task
order and modeling response latency. We evaluate our technique on a breadth of
common labeling tasks such as image verification, word similarity, sentiment
analysis and topic classification. Where prior work typically achieves a 0.25x
to 1x speedup over fixed majority vote, our approach often achieves an order of
magnitude (10x) speedup.

%X Crowdsourced clustering approaches present a promising way to harness deep
semantic knowledge for clustering complex information. However, existing
approaches have difficulties supporting the global context needed for workers
to generate meaningful categories, and are costly because all items require
human judgments. We introduce Alloy, a hybrid approach that combines the
richness of human judgments with the power of machine algorithms. Alloy
supports greater global context through a new "sample and search" crowd pattern
which changes the crowd's task from classifying a fixed subset of items to
actively sampling and querying the entire dataset. It also improves efficiency
through a two phase process in which crowds provide examples to help a machine
cluster the head of the distribution, then classify low-confidence examples in
the tail. To accomplish this, Alloy introduces a modular "cast and gather"
approach which leverages a machine learning backbone to stitch together
different types of judgment tasks.

%X Software development is an expert task that requires complex reasoning and
the ability to recall language or API-specific details. In practice, developers
often seek support from IDE tools, Web resources, or other developers to help
fill in gaps in their knowledge on-demand. In this paper, we present two
studies that seek to inform the design of future systems that use remote
experts to support developers on demand. The first explores what types of
questions developers would ask a hypothetical assistant capable of answering
any question they pose. The second study explores the interactions between
developers and remote experts in supporting roles. Our results suggest eight
key system features needed for on-demand remote developer assistants to be
effective, which has implications for future human-powered development tools.

%X Software ecosystems as a paradigm for large-scale software development
encompass a complex mix of technical, business, and social aspects. While
significant research has been conducted to understand both the technical and
business aspects, the social aspects of software ecosystems are less well
understood. To close this gap, this paper presents the results of an empirical
study aimed at understanding the influence of social aspects on developers'
participation in software ecosystems. We conducted 25 interviews with mobile
software developers and an online survey with 83 respondents from the mobile
software development community. Our results point out a complex social system
based on continued interaction and mutual support between different actors,
including developers, friends, end users, developers from large companies, and
online communities. These findings highlight the importance of social aspects
in the sustainability of software ecosystems both during the initial adoption
phase as well as for long-term permanence of developers.

%X Updates alter the way software functions by fixing bugs, changing features,
and modifying the user interface. Sometimes changes are welcome, even
anticipated, and sometimes they are unwanted leading to users avoiding
potentially unwanted updates. If users delay or do not install updates it can
have serious security implications for their computer. Updates are one of the
primary mechanisms for correcting discovered vulnerabilities, when a user does
not update they remain vulnerable to an increasing number of attacks. In this
work we detail the process users go through when updating their software,
including both the positive and negative issues they experience. We asked 307
survey respondents to provide two contrasting software update stories. Using
content analysis we analysed the stories and found that users go through six
stages while updating: awareness, deciding to update, preparation,
installation, troubleshooting, and post state. We further detail the issues
respondents experienced during each stage and the impact on their willingness
to update.

very broad array of connections that appear to fill gaps in functionality, yet

%X Documentation and unit tests increase software maintainability, but real
world software projects rarely have adequate coverage. We hypothesize that, in
part, this is because existing authoring tools require developers to adjust
their workflows significantly. To study whether improved interaction design
could affect unit testing and documentation practice, we created an authoring
support tool called Vesta. The main insight guiding Vesta's interaction design
is that developers frequently manually test the software they are building. We
propose leveraging runtime information from these manual executions. Because
developers naturally exercise the part of the code on which they are currently
working, this information will be highly relevant to appropriate documentation
and testing tasks. In a complex coding task, nearly all documentation created
using Vesta was accurate, compared to only 60% of documentation created without
Vesta, and Vesta was able to generate significant portions of all tests, even
those written manually by developers without Vesta.

%X We present a new method of rendering aerial haptic images that uses
femtosecond-laser light fields and ultrasonic acoustic fields. In conventional
research, a single physical quantity has been used to render aerial haptic
images. In contrast, our method combines multiple fields (light and acoustic
fields) at the same time. While these fields have no direct interference,
combining them provides benefits such as multi-resolution haptic images and a
synergistic effect on haptic perception. We conducted user studies with laser
haptics and ultrasonic haptics separately and tested their superposition. The
results showed that the acoustic field affects the tactile perception of the
laser haptics. We explored augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR)
applications such as providing haptic feedback of the combination of these two
methods. We believe that the results of this study contribute to the
exploration of laser haptic displays and expand the expression of aerial haptic
displays based on other principles.

%X Vibrotactile (VT) display is becoming a standard component of informative
user experience, where notifications and feedback must convey information
eyes-free. However, effective design is hindered by incomplete understanding of
relevant perceptual qualities, together with the need for user feedback to be
accessed in-situ. To access evaluation streamlining now common in visual
design, we introduce proxy modalities as a way to crowdsource VT sensations by
reliably communicating high-level features through a crowd-accessible channel.
We investigate two proxy modalities to represent a high-fidelity tactor: a new
VT visualization, and low-fidelity vibratory translations playable on commodity
smartphones. We translated 10 high-fidelity vibrations into both modalities,
and in two user studies found that both proxy modalities can communicate
affective features, and are consistent when deployed remotely over Mechanical
Turk. We analyze fit of features to modalities, and suggest future
improvements.

%X Smartwatches and activity trackers are becoming prevalent, providing
information about health and fitness, and offering personalized progress
monitoring. These wearable devices often offer multimodal feedback with
embedded visual, audio, and vibrotactile displays. Vibrations are particularly
useful when providing discreet feedback, without users having to look at a
display or anyone else noticing, thus preserving the flow of the primary
activity. Yet, current use of vibrations is limited to basic patterns, since
representing more complex information with a single actuator is challenging.
Moreover, it is unclear how much the user -- s current physical activity may
interfere with their understanding of the vibrations. We address both issues
through the design and evaluation of ActiVibe, a set of vibrotactile icons
designed to represent progress through the values 1 to 10. We demonstrate a
recognition rate of over 96% in a laboratory setting using a commercial
smartwatch. ActiVibe was also evaluated in situ with 22 participants for a
28-day period. We show that the recognition rate is 88.7% in the wild and give
a list of factors that affect the recognition, as well as provide design
guidelines for communicating progress via vibrations.

%X Online fitness videos make it possible and popular to do exercise at home.
However, it is not easy to notice the details of motions by merely watching
training videos. We propose a new type of motion guidance system that simulates
the way that the human body moves as driven by muscle contractions. We have
designed external artificial muscles on a sleeve to create a pulling sensation
that can guide the forearm's pronation (internal rotation) and the forearm's
supination (external rotation). The sleeve consists of stepper motors to
provide pulling force, fishing lines and elastic bands to imitate muscle
contraction to drive the forearm to rotate instinctively. We present two
preliminary experiments. The first one shows that this system can effectively
guide the forearm to rotate in the correct direction. The second one shows that
users can be guided to the targeted angle by utilizing a tactile cue. We also
report users' feedback through the experiments and provide design
recommendations and directions for future research.

%X A tool able to generate remote forces would allow us to handle dangerous or
fragile materials without contact or occlusions. Acoustic levitation is a
suitable technology since it can trap particles in air or water. However, no
approach has tried to endow humans with an intertwined way of controlling it.
Previously, the acoustic elements were static, had to surround the particles
and only translation was possible. Here, we present the basic manoeuvres that
can be performed when levitators are attached to our moving hands. A Gauntlet
of Levitation and a Sonic Screwdriver are presented with their manoeuvres for
capturing, moving, transferring and combining particles. Manoeuvres can be
performed manually or assisted by a computer for repeating patterns,
stabilization and enhanced accuracy or speed. The presented prototypes still
have limited forces but symbolize a milestone in our expectations of future
technology.

%X We present a computational model to predict users' spatio-temporal visual
attention on WIMP-style (windows, icons, menus, pointer) graphical user
interfaces. Like existing models of bottom-up visual attention in computer
vision, our model does not require any eye tracking equipment. Instead, it
predicts attention solely using information available to the interface,
specifically users' mouse and keyboard input as well as the UI components they
interact with. To study our model in a principled way, we further introduce a
method to synthesize user interface layouts that are functionally equivalent to
real-world interfaces, such as from Gmail, Facebook, or GitHub. We first
quantitatively analyze attention allocation and its correlation with user input
and UI components using ground-truth gaze, mouse, and keyboard data of 18
participants performing a text editing task. We then show that our model
predicts attention maps more accurately than state-of-the-art methods. Our
results underline the significant potential of spatio-temporal attention
modeling for user interface evaluation, optimization, or even simulation.

%X Data-entry is a common activity that is usually performed accurately. When
errors do occur though, people are poor at spotting them even if they are told
to check their input. We considered whether making people pause for a brief
moment before confirming their input would make them more likely to check it.
We ran a lab experiment to test this idea. We found that task lockouts
encouraged checking. Longer lockout durations made checking more likely. We ran
a second experiment on a crowdsourcing platform to find out whether lockouts
would still be effective in a less controlled setting. We discovered that
longer lockouts induced workers to switch to other activities. This made the
lockouts less effective. To be useful in practice, the duration of lockouts
needs to be carefully calibrated. If lockouts are too brief they will not
encourage checking. If they are too long they will induce switching.

%X Web applications often need to present the user new information in the
context of their current activity. Designers rely on a range of UI elements and
visual techniques to present the new content to users, such as pop-ups, message
icons, and marquees. Web designers need to select which technique to use
depending on the centrality of the information and how quickly they need a
reaction. However, designers often rely on intuition and anecdotes rather than
empirical evidence to drive their decision-making as to which presentation
technique to use. This work represents an attempt to quantify these
presentation style decisions. We present a large (n=1505) user study that
compares 15 visual attention-grabbing techniques with respect to reaction time,
noticeability, annoyance, likability, and recall. We suggest glowing shadows
and message icons with badges, as well as more possibilities for future work.

%X This paper presents an investigation of how the Scottish electorate utilised
photo-sharing on social media as a means of participation in the democratic
process and for political self-expression in the periods immediately prior to
two recent major democratic votes: the 2014 Scottish independence referendum,
and the 2015 UK general election. We extend previous HCI literature on the
growing use of social media in a political context and contribute specifically
on understanding the emergent use of visual media by citizens when engaging
with political issues and democratic process. Through a qualitative analysis of
images shared on the platform Instagram, we demonstrate that the Scottish
electorate did indeed used image-sharing for political self-expression --
posting a variety of visual content, representative of a diversity of political
opinion. We conclude that users utilised Instagram as a platform to craft and
present their "political selves". We raise questions for future research around
power and inequality on such platforms as well as their capability of providing
a persistent forum for debate.

%X We present a study of 10-month Twitter discussions on the controversial
topic of Edward Snowden. We demonstrate how behavioral differences of opinion
groups can distort the presence of opinions on a social media platform. By
studying the differences between a numerical minority (anti-Snowden) and a
majority (pro-Snowden) group, we found that the minority group engaged in a
"shared audiencing" practice with more persistent production of original
tweets, focusing increasingly on inter-personal interactions with like-minded
others. The majority group engaged in a "gatewatching" practice by
disseminating information from the group, and over time shifted further from
making original comments to retweeting others'. The findings show consistency
with previous social science research on how social environment shapes majority
and minority group behaviors. We also highlight that they can be further
distorted by the collective use of social media design features such as the
"retweet" button, by introducing the concept of "amplification'" to measure how
a design feature biases the voice of an opinion group. Our work presents a
warning to not oversimplify analysis of social media data for inferring social
opinions.

%X Bosnia-Herzegovina and its administrative unit or "entity", Republika Srpska
are divided, transitional post-war societies. The aim of this paper is to
present a preliminary analysis of regional activists' use of information and
communication technology (ICT) and to identify improvement potential. Empirical
investigations of social media use and qualitative interviews with the
country's activists indicate strong interest in ICT. Benefits for the use of
ICT by activists include more efficient access to their target group, easier
information sharing with the general population, and quicker reaction to
spontaneous "offline" activities. Simultaneously, data points to problems such
as limited budgets and know-how, intensive outsourcing practices, and a
significant lack of awareness regarding data security. Activists see
improvement potential in areas of training on content optimization, campaign
management, ICT use and maintenance, security, and privacy. Additionally, there
is potential to improve upon the sustainability of activist's work and patterns
related to their ICT outsourcing.

%X In the past few years an unprecedented wave of anti-abortion policies were
introduced and enacted in state governments in the U.S., affecting millions of
constituents. We study this rapid spread of policy change as a function of the
underlying ideology of constituents. We examine over 200,000 public messages
posted on Twitter surrounding abortion in the year 2013, a year that saw 82 new
anti-abortion policies enacted. From these posts, we characterize people's
expressions of opinion on abortion and show how these expressions align with
policy change on these issues. We detail a number of ideological differences
between constituents in states enacting anti versus pro-abortion policies, such
as a tension between the moral values of purity versus fairness, and a
differing emphasis on the fetus versus the pregnant woman. We also find
significant differences in how males versus females discuss the issue of
abortion, including greater emphasis on health and religion by males. Using
these measures to characterize states, we can construct models to explain the
spread of abortion policy from state to state and project which types of
abortion policies a state will introduce. Models defining state similarity
using our Twitter-based measures improved policy projection accuracy by 7.32%
and 12.02% on average over geographic and poll-based ideological similarity,
respectively. Additionally, models constructed from the expressions of
male-only constituents perform better than models from the expressions of
female-only constituents, suggesting that the ideology of men is more aligned
with the recent spread of anti-abortion legislation than that of women.

%X Elicitation studies, where users supply proposals meant to effect system
commands, have become a popular method for system designers. But the method to
date has assumed a within-subjects procedure and statistics. Despite the
benefits of examining the relative agreement of independent groups (e.g., men
versus women, children versus adults, novices versus experts, etc.), the lack
of appropriate tools for between-subjects agreement rate analysis have
prevented so far such comparative investigations. In this work, we expand the
elicitation method to between-subjects designs. We introduce a new measure for
evaluating coagreement between groups and a new statistical test for agreement
rate analysis that reports the exact p-value to evaluate the significance of
the difference between agreement rates calculated for independent groups. We
show the usefulness of our tools by re-examining previously published gesture
elicitation data, for which we discuss significant differences in agreement for
technical and non-technical participants, men and women, and different
acquisition technologies. Our new tools will enable practitioners to properly
analyze their user-elicited data resulted from complex experimental designs
with multiple independent groups and, consequently, will help them understand
agreement data and verify hypotheses about agreement at more sophisticated
levels of analysis.

%X Gestural interaction has become increasingly popular, as enabling
technologies continue to transition from research to retail. The mobility of
miniaturized (and invisible) technologies introduces new uses for gesture
recognition. This paper investigates single-hand microgestures (SHMGs),
detailed gestures in a small interaction space. SHMGs are suitable for the
mobile and discrete nature of interactions for ubiquitous computing. However,
there has been a lack of end-user input in the design of such gestures. We
performed a user-elicitation study with 16 participants to determine their
preferred gestures for a set of referents. We contribute an analysis of 1,632
gestures, the resulting gesture set, and prevalent conceptual themes amongst
the elicited gestures. These themes provide a set of guidelines for gesture
designers, while informing the designs of future studies. With the increase in
hand-tracking and electronic devices in our surroundings, we see this as a
starting point for designing gestures suitable to portable ubiquitous
computing.

gestural technique based on the principle of rhythmic path mimicry; by
replicating the movement of a screen-represented pattern with their hand, users
can intuitively interact with digital objects quickly, and with a high level of
accuracy. We present three studies that each contribute (1) improvements to how
correlation is calculated in path-mimicry techniques necessary for touchless
interaction, (2) a validation of its efficiency in comparison to existing
techniques, and (3) a demonstration of its intuitiveness and multi-user
capacity 'in the wild'. Our studies consequently demonstrate PathSync's
potential as an immediately legitimate alternative to existing techniques, with
key advantages for public display and multi-user applications.

between a player's sense of her narrative role in an interactive narrative
role-playing game and the options she selects when faced with choice structures
during gameplay. By manipulating a player's knowledge over her role, and
examining in-game options she preferred in choice structures, we discovered
what we term the Mimesis Effect: when players were explicitly given a role, we
found a significant relationship between their role and their in-game actions;
participants role-play even if not instructed to, exhibiting a preference for
actions consistent with their role. Further, when players were not explicitly
given a role, participants still role-played -- they were consistent with an
implicit role -- but did not agree on which role to implicitly be consistent
with. We discuss our findings and broader implications of our work to both game
development and games research.

%X Digital games require players to learn various skills, which is often
accomplished through play itself. In multiplayer games, novices can feel
overwhelmed if competing against better players, and can fail to improve, which
may lead to unsatisfying play and missed social play opportunities. To help
novices learn the requisite skills, we first determined how experts accomplish
an important task in multiplayer FPS games -- locating their opponent. After
determining that an understanding of audio cues and how to leverage them was
critical, we designed and evaluated two systems for introducing this skill of
locating opponents through audio cues -- a training system, and a modified game
interface. We found that both systems improved accuracy and confidence, but
that the training system led to more audio cues being recognized. Our work may
help people of disparate skill play together, by scaffolding novices to learn
and use a strategy commonly employed by experts.

%X In social play settings, it can be difficult for people with different skill
levels to play a game together. Player balancing that provides skill assistance
for the weaker player can allow for enjoyable play experiences; however,
previous research (and conventional wisdom) has suggested that skill assistance
should be kept hidden to avoid perceptions of unfairness. We carried out a
study to test how disclosing skill assistance affects player experience. We
found -- surprisingly -- that disclosing assistance did not harm play
experience; players were more influenced by the benefits of equalized
performance resulting from assistance than by their knowledge of the assist. We
introduce the idea of attribution biases to help explain why awareness was not
harmful -- people tend to take credit for their successes, but attribute
failures externally. We discuss how game designers can incorporate skill
assistance to build multiplayer games that improve experiences for a wide range
of players.

gaming expertise and cognitive skills, and the value of recruiting and running
participants at a MOBA gaming tournament. Participants completed a set of
cognitive tasks that measured spatial working and long term (location) memory,
basic cognitive processing, and gaming experience. Comparable reliability on
the working memory task and results in line with previous research on the
location memory task indicated the data collected was valid and reliable. We
observed a significant relation between gaming experience and response time on
the location memory task. We discuss that conducting gaming research at a
tournament is a valid way of collecting data for a gaming expertise study while

%X Considerable research has focused on the problems that end users face when
programming software, in order to help them overcome their difficulties, but
there is little research into the problems that arise in physical computing
when end users construct circuits and program them. In an empirical study, we
observed end-user developers as they connected a temperature sensor to an
Arduino microcontroller and visualized its readings using LEDs. We investigated
how many problems participants encountered, the problem locations, and whether
they were overcome. We show that most fatal faults were due to incorrect
circuit construction, and that often problems were wrongly diagnosed as program
bugs. Whereas there are development environments that help end users create and
debug software, there is currently little analogous support for physical
computing tasks. Our work is a first step towards building appropriate tools
that support end-user developers in overcoming obstacles when constructing
physical computing artifacts.

%X Many disciplines, including health science, increasingly demand custom
applications that synthesize cloud, mobile and web functionality. But creating
even simple apps is difficult. Why? In this paper, guided by Cognitive
Dimensions, we explore the design space for relevant programming notations and
supporting tools, and we pinpoint what we hypothesize to be specific obstacles
in the creation of cloud-mobile-web apps. Among these is the prevalence of
hidden dependencies within code of apps. Based on this analysis, we propose a
new notation called LondonTube aimed at making these hidden dependencies
visible, thereby helping health scientists to create apps for themselves. A
study showed that LondonTube reduced the time to create a cloud-mobile-web app
by a factor of over 20, and it reduced questions about hidden dependencies.

when many of these variants are similar. This situation, which is largely
overlooked in the literature, is commonplace in several types of creative
tasks, one of which is exploratory programming. In this paper, we investigate
how novice programmers forage through similar variants. Based on our results,
we propose a refinement to Information Foraging Theory (IFT) to include
constructs about variation foraging behavior, and propose refinements to
computational models of IFT to better account for foraging among variants.

%X Exploring source code history is an important task for software maintenance.
Traditionally, source code history is navigated on the granularity of
individual files. This is not fine-grained enough to support users in exploring
the evolution of individual code elements. We suggest to consider the history
of individual elements within the tree structure inherent to source code. A
history graph created from these trees then enables new ways to explore events
of interest defined by structural changes in the source code. We present Tree
Flow, a visualization of these structural changes designed to enable users to
choose the appropriate level of detail for the task at hand. In a user study,
we show that both Chronicler and the history aware timeline, two prototype
systems combining history graph navigation with a traditional source code view,
outperform the more traditional history navigation on a file basis and users
strongly prefer Chronicler for the exploration of source code.

%X Eye-typing is an important tool for people with physical disabilities and,
for some, it is their main form of communication. By observing expert typists
using physical keyboards, we notice that visual throughput is considerably
reduced in current eye-typing solutions. We propose AugKey to improve
throughput by augmenting keys with a prefix, to allow continuous text
inspection, and suffixes to speed up typing with word prediction. AugKey limits
the visual information to the foveal region to minimize eye movements (i.e.,
reduce eye work). We have applied AugKey to a dwell-time keyboard and compared
its performance with two conditions with no augmented feedback: a keyboard with
and one without word prediction. Results show that AugKey can be about 28%
faster than no word prediction and 20% faster than traditional word prediction,
with a smaller workload index.

%X Awareness of the huge amount of work faced by relatives in caring for a
person suffering from a loss of autonomy has led to research focusing on ways
to ease the burden on informal caregivers. Among them, services and devices
aimed at providing social support and fighting the isolation that may be caused
by the caregiving tasks appear important. However, little is known about the
social support informal caregivers actually value and look for in practice. To
fill this gap, we conducted a multi-sited study, focusing on older informal
caregivers, because they are numerous and have lower experience with
technology. Our study highlights that being part of a group is a key element in
helping informal caregivers to feel that they are not alone, continue leisure
activities, learn from others and sustain participation in organized
activities. Through this understanding, we discuss design opportunities in a
sociotechnical approach complementing online and offline social support.

%X Social support can significantly improve health outcomes for individuals
living with disease, and online forums have emerged as an important vehicle for
social support. Whereas research has focused on the delivery and use of social
support, little is known about how these communities are sustained. We describe
one sociotechnical mechanism that enables sustainable communities to provide
social support to a large number of people. We focus upon thirteen
disease-specific discussion forums hosted by the WebMD online health community.
In these forums, small, densely connected cores of members who maintain strong
relationships generate the majority of support for others. Through content
analysis we find they provide informational support to a large number of more
itinerant members, but provide one another with community support. Based on
these observations, we describe a sociotechnical mechanism of online support
that is distinct from non-support oriented communities, and has implications
for the design of self-sustaining online support systems.

encodes discrete color information into spatiotemporal vibrations to support
colorblind users to recognize and compare colors. We ran three experiments: the
first found the optimal number and placement of motors around the wrist-worn
prototype, and the second tested the optimal way to represent discrete points
between the vibration motors. Results suggested that using three vibration
motors and pulses of varying duration to encode proximity information in
spatiotemporal patterns is the optimal solution. Finally, we evaluated the
HaptiColor prototype and encodings with six colorblind participants. Our
results show that the participants were able to easily understand the encodings
and perform color comparison tasks accurately (94.4% to 100%).

%X Words and language are central to most human communication. This paper
explores the importance of language for the participatory design of smart home
technologies for healthcare. We argue that to effectively involve a broad range
of users in the design of new technologies, it is important to actively develop
a shared language that is accessible to and owned by all stakeholders, and that
facilitates productive dialogues among them. Our discussion is grounded firstly
in work with end users, in which problematic language emerged as a key barrier
to participation and effective design. Three specific categories of language
barriers are identified: jargon, ambiguity, and emotive words. Building on this
we undertook a workshop and focus group, respectively involving researchers
developing smart health technologies and users, where the focus was on
generating a shared language. We discuss this process, including examples that
emerged of alternative terminology and specific strategies for creating a
shared language.

%X Participatory Design (PD) gives users a voice in the design of technologies
they are meant to use. When PD methods are adapted for research with children,
design teams need to address additional issues of ethical accountability (e.g.,
adult-child power relations). While researchers have taken measures to ensure
ethical accountability in PD research with children, to our knowledge there has
been no work examining how former child design partners view ethical issues
surrounding their participation. In this work we ask: How do children view
ethical issues around their role on Participatory Design teams? We present
findings from surveys and interviews with 12 former child design partners.
Findings, identified by the former participants themselves, outline: (i)
balancing attribution and anonymity, (ii) promoting ongoing consent and
dissent, and (iii) cultivating a balanced design partnership. From these
findings we recommend practices for researchers and designers of children's
technologies that align with participant views.

%X Partnering with parents and children in the design process can be important
for producing technologies that take into consideration the rich context of
family life. However, to date, few studies have examined the actual process of
designing with families and their children. Without understanding the process,
we risk making poor design choices in user-interactive experiences that take
into account important family dynamics. The purpose of this investigation is to
understand how parent-child relationships in families shape co-design processes
and how they are reshaped through co-design. We document the evolutionary
process and outcomes that exist in co-design partnerships between researchers
and families. We found that parents' engagement patterns shifted more slowly
than that of children's from observing and facilitating to design partnering
practices. Our analysis suggests the importance of establishing and nurturing
social bonds among parents, children, and researchers in the co-design process.

platforms for activism: they provide a platform by which voices can be heard
and collective action mobilized. Yet, little work has studied the suitability
of existing SNAs for enabling youth advocacy efforts. We conducted an intensive
5-week qualitative study with 10th graders to understand how existing SNAs
support and inhibit youth advocacy. We contribute to the field of
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) by explicating several themes regarding the
barriers youth face when using SNAs for advocacy, features in existing SNAs
that are not suitable for youth advocacy, and the peer pressure youth perceive
when advocating for serious issues in these environments. We conclude with
recommendations for how existing SNA features could be reformed to better
support youth advocacy.

allow voluntary and community sector care organisations to gather feedback and
opinions from those who use their services. In this paper we describe the
design and development of ThoughtCloud and its evaluation through a series of
deployments with two organisations. Using the system, organisations were able
to pose questions about the activities that they provide and gather data in the
form of ratings, video or audio messages. We conducted observations of
ThoughtCloud in use, analysed feedback received, and conducted interviews with
those who 'commissioned' feedback around the value of comments received about
their organisation. Our findings highlight how simple, easily deployable
digital systems can support new feedback processes within care organisations
and provide opportunities for understanding the personal journeys and
experiences of vulnerable individuals who use these care services.

performed reading tasks on the most popular text-heavy website of the Web:
Wikipedia. Using a hybrid-measures design, we compared objective and subjective
readability and comprehension of the articles for font sizes ranging from 10 to
26 points, and line spacings ranging from 0.8 to 1.8 (font: Arial). Our
findings provide evidence that readability, measured via mean fixation
duration, increased significantly with font size. Further, comprehension
questions had significantly more correct responses for font sizes 18 and 26.
For line spacing, we found marginal effects, suggesting that the two tested
extremes (0.8 and 1.8) impair readability. These findings provide evidence that
text-heavy websites should use fonts of size 18 or larger and use default line
spacing when the goal is to make a web page easy to read and comprehend. Our
results significantly differ from previous recommendations, presumably, because
this is the first work to cover font sizes beyond 14 points.

by the ISO 9421-9 standard. In the experiment, we compared two methods of bend
input: position control and rate control of a cursor. Participants performed
the task with three levels of device stiffness. Results show that bend input is
highly correlated with Fitts' law for both position and rate control. Position
control produced significantly higher throughput values than rate control. Our
experiment also revealed that, when the amount of force applied was controlled,
device stiffness did not have a significant effect on performance.

representations. The work we present involves 18 participants with a scientific
background in a similarity perception study. The study asks participants to
group a carefully selected set of plots according to their subjective
perceptual judgement of similarity, and it integrates the results into a
consensus similarity grouping. We then use this consensus grouping to generate
insights on similarity perception. The main output of this work is a list of
concepts we derive to describe major perceptual features, and a description of
how these concepts relate and rank. We also evaluate scagnostics (scatter plot
diagnostics), a popular and established set of scatter plot descriptors, and
show that they do not reliably reproduce our participants judgements. Finally,
we discuss the major implications of this study and how these results can be
used for future research.

networks for data exploration, we want to see if we can take advantage of the
visual expressiveness and familiarity of comics to present and explain temporal
changes in networks to an audience. To understand the potential of comics as a
storytelling medium, we first created a variety of comics during a 3 month
structured design process, involving domain experts from public education and
neuroscience. This process led to the definition of 8 design factors for
creating graph comics and propose design solutions for each. Results from a
qualitative study suggest that a general audience is quickly able understand
complex temporal changes through graph comics, provided with minimal textual
annotations and no training.

%X Tactile displays have predominantly been used for information transfer using
patterns or as assistive feedback for interactions. With recent advances in
hardware for conveying increasingly rich tactile information that mirrors
visual information, and the increasing viability of wearables that remain in
constant contact with the skin, there is a compelling argument for exploring
tactile interactions as rich as visual displays. Direct Manipulation underlies
much of the advances in visual interactions. In this work, we introduce the
concept of a Direct Manipulation-enabled Tactile display (DMT). We define the
concepts of a tactile screen, tactile pixel, tactile pointer, and tactile
target which enable tactile pointing, selection and drag &amp; drop. We build a
proof of concept tactile display and study its precision limits. We further
develop a performance model for DMTs based on a tactile target acquisition
study. Finally, we study user performance in a real-world DMT menu application.
The results show that users are able to use the application with relative ease
and speed.

%X A virtual touch screen concept using an optical see-through head-mounted
display has been suggested. With a virtual touch screen, the user's
direct-touch interactions are allowed in much the same way as a conventional
touch screen, but the absence of haptic feedback and physical constraint leads
to poor user performance. To overcome this issue, we developed a wearable
haptic device, called HapThimble. It provides various types of haptic feedback
(tactile, pseudo-force, and vibrotactile) to the user's fingertip and mimics
physical buttons based on force-penetration depth curves. We conducted three
experiments with HapThimble. The first experiment confirmed that HapThimble
could increase a users' performance when conducting clicking and dragging
tasks. The second experiment revealed that users could differentiate between
six types of haptic feedback, rendered based on different force-penetration
depth curves obtained using HapThimble. Last, we conducted a test to
investigate the similarity between the physical buttons and the mimicked haptic
buttons and obtained a 90.3% success rate.

%X Current mobile devices do not leverage the rich haptic channel of
information that our hands can sense, and instead focus primarily on touch
based graphical interfaces. Our goal is to enrich the user experience of these
devices through bi-directional haptic and tactile interactions (display and
control) around the edge of hand-held devices. We propose a novel type of
haptic interface, a Haptic Edge Display, consisting of actuated pins on the
side of a display, to form a linear array of tactile pixels (taxels). These
taxels are implemented using small piezoelectric actuators, which can be made
cheaply and have
